# rp4

simple python replacement for the bloated LLM frontends

rp4 */fourp/* is a simple and minimalist LLM frontend initially written in a few days, not without the help of LLMs.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI.

```bash
pipx install rp4
```

### Install from GitHub.

```bash
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/asakura42/rp4.git'
```

### Clone and install.

```bash
git clone ...
pipx install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
rp4 --gui
```

The program uses [https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free](gpt4free) library or your own OpenAI-compatible completions API.

This program was written for the own use and is still in development,
so it may not always work the way the user expects.
For example, if the model does not change, simply close and reopen the program.

## Configuration

Config files are stored in `~/.config/rp4`.

## TODO
- various quotes handling
- aicg proxy parsing (do I really need it?)

Any improvements, issues, thoughts and pull requests will be appreciated.
