    Args:
    ----
    command (str | list[str]): The command or list of commands to be executed by the shell.

    The following keyword arguments are all optional:
    shell (str | Path): The shell that will be used to execute the commands.
        Can be a name/path (str) or a pathlib Path (e.g. "bash", "/bin/bash").
        Defaults to the shell that invoked the script.
    check (bool): If True, an error will be thrown if a command exits with a non-zero status.
        Similar to bash's "set -e". Defaults to True.
    show_output (bool): If True, command output will be printed. Defaults to True.
    show_command (bool): If True, the current command will be printed before execution. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
    -------
    ShellCommandResult: The result of the shell command execution.

    Raises:
    ------
    ShellResolutionError: Raised if an error occurs when resolving the path to the shell.
    ShellCommandError: If check is True, this is raised if a command exits with a non-zero status.
    ShellRunnerError: Raised when an unexpected error occurs.
        Usually an execution error with this function, not necessarily the provided command.

    The only way to reliably stop executing commands on an error is to exit from the shell itself.
    Killing the subprocess does not happen nearly fast enough.
    To do this, we append a command for each command that is passed in.
    Ultimately, we need to get PIPESTATUS, process it, and exit based on that. PIPESTATUS looks like: "0 1 0".
    We don't need to also get $?/$status because PIPESTATUS gives the status of single command anyway.
    Rather than write a separate script for each shell to process PIPESTATUS
    (e.g. bash would require a different script than fish), we can pass PIPESTATUS into a python script.
    We execute this python script by passing it to the parent python executable (sys.executable) via the -c flag.
    The following python code (status_check) takes in PIPESTATUS, prints it (so we can capture it from stdout later on),
    loops through each status, and exits (with a non-zero status if there is one).

    """
    We use "⽌" and "⾏" as markers (that we'll likely never come across in the wild) to detect when
    a given command has finished. That way we can separately capture PIPESTATUS from stdout (and not print it).
    The markers are Japanese radicals rather than full Kanji, so they do not appear in "normal" Japanese text.
    e.g. we use ⾏ (U+2F8F) instead of 行 (U+884C).
    We read stdout on each character rather than by line, so we have to detect on a single character.
    ^ See the subprocess while loop.
    In the above print statement, we use unicode escapes to "hide" the characters from the shell.
    '\u2f4c' == ⽌ | '\u2f8f' == ⾏
    This is to prevent errors that would arise if the shell reprints the command. For example, when fish receives an
    unknown command in a pipeline, it reprints the entire command to point out where the error occurred.
    If we used the actual characters in that case, we would fail to correctly capture pipestatus because we would be
    capturing the literal command sent to the shell, not pipestatus as printed from the code.
