# RMLdoc

RMLdoc is a tool designed to simplify the process of generating documentation for RML (RDF Mapping Language) mappings. It automates the documentation generation process, allowing users to easily understand and share the mappings defined within their projects.

## Features

- **Automated Documentation Generation**: RMLdoc automatically generates documentation for RML mappings, eliminating the need for manual documentation efforts.
- **Clear and Readable Output**: The generated documentation provides clear and concise descriptions of the logical sources, subject maps, predicate-object maps, and other components defined within the RML mappings.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: RMLdoc provides a simple command-line interface for easy integration into existing workflows and build processes.

## Installation

### From pypi
rmldoc is available in pypi!

```bash
pip install rmldoc
```

### From source

To install RMLdoc, simply clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install the package:
```
pip install -e .
```
## Usage

rmldoc offers the following options:
```bash
usage: rmldoc [-h] -i INPUT_MAPPING_PATH [-o OUTPUT_PATH]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_MAPPING_PATH, --input_mapping_path INPUT_MAPPING_PATH
                        Path to the input mapping file in RML format.
  -o OUTPUT_PATH, --output_path OUTPUT_PATH
                        Path to save the generated document. Default output is output.md

```


To generate documentation for your RML mappings, use the following command:

```bash
rmldoc -i path/to/rml/mappings.rml - o path/to/output/directory/mappings.md
```

Replace `path/to/rml/mappings.rml` with the path to your RML mapping file and `path/to/output/directory/mappings.md` with the file where you want the documentation to be generated.
