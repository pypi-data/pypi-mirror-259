A semi-opinionanted RAG framework.

<img src="./docs/pages/r2r.png" alt="Sciphi Framework">
R2R was conceived to bridge the gap between experimental RAG models and robust, production-ready systems. Our semi-opinionated framework cuts through the complexity, offering a straightforward path to deploy, adapt, and maintain RAG pipelines in production. We prioritize simplicity and practicality, aiming to set a new industry benchmark for ease of use and effectiveness.

### Quick Install:

**Install R2R directly using `pip`:**

```bash
# use the `'r2r[all]'` to download all required deps
pip install 'r2r[parsing]'
```

## Basic Examples

The project includes several basic examples that demonstrate application deployment and interaction:

1. [`app.py`](examples/basic/app.py): This example runs the main application, which includes the ingestion, embedding, and RAG pipelines served via FastAPI.

   ```bash
   uvicorn r2r.examples.basic.app:app
   ```

2. [`run_client.py`](examples/basic/run_client.py): This example should be run after starting the main application. It demonstrates uploading text entries as well as a PDF to the local server with the python client. Further, it shows document and user-level vector management with built-in features.

   ```bash
   python -m r2r.examples.basic.run_client
   ```

3. [`run_pdf_chat.py`](examples/pdf_chat/run_demo.py): An example demonstrating upload and chat with a more realistic pdf.

   ```bash
   # Ingest pdf
   python -m r2r.examples.pdf_chat.run_demo ingest

   # Ask a question
   python -m r2r.examples.pdf_chat.run_demo search "What are the key themes of Meditations?"
   ```

4. [`web`](web/package.json): A web application which is meant to accompany the framework to provide visual intelligence.
   ```bash
   cd $workdir/web && pnpm install
   # Serve the web app
   pnpm dev
   ```

### Full Install:

Follow these steps to ensure a smooth setup:

1. **Install Poetry:**

   - Before installing the project, make sure you have Poetry on your system. If not, visit the [official Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for installation instructions.

2. **Clone and Install Dependencies:**

   - Clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:SciPhi-AI/r2r.git
     cd r2r
     ```
    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. This file is in the main project folder:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env 
     ```
   - Install the project dependencies with Poetry:
     ```bash
     # See pyproject.toml for available extras
     # use "all" to include every optional dependency
     poetry install --extras "parsing"
     ```
   - Execute with poetry run:
     ```bash
     poetry run python -m r2r.examples.pdf_chat.run_demo ingest
     ```


3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - You need to set up cloud provider secrets in your `.env`. At a minimum, you will need an OpenAI key.
   - The framework currently supports PostgreSQL (locally), pgvector and Qdrant with plans to extend coverage.

## Key Features

- **üöÄ Rapid Deployment**: Facilitates a smooth setup and development of production-ready RAG systems.
- **‚öñÔ∏è Flexible Standarization**: `Ingestion`, `Embedding`, and `RAG` with proper `Observability`.
- **üß© Easy to modify**: Provides a structure that can be extended to deploy your own custom pipelines.
- **üì¶ Versioning**: Ensures your work remains reproducible and traceable through version control.
- **üîå Extensibility**: Enables a quick and robust integration with various VectorDBs, LLMs and Embeddings Models.
- **ü§ñ OSS Driven**: Built for and by the OSS community, to help startups and enterprises to quickly build with RAG.
- **üìù Deployment Support**: Available to help you build and deploy your RAG systems end-to-end.

## Core Abstractions

The framework primarily revolves around three core abstractions:

- The **Ingestion Pipeline**: Facilitates the preparation of embeddable 'Documents' from various data formats (json, txt, pdf, html, etc.). The abstraction can be found in [`ingestion.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/ingestion.py).

- The **Embedding Pipeline**: Manages the transformation of text into stored vector embeddings, interacting with embedding and vector database providers through a series of steps (e.g., extract_text, transform_text, chunk_text, embed_chunks, etc.). The abstraction can be found in [`embedding.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/embedding.py).

- The **RAG Pipeline**: Works similarly to the embedding pipeline but incorporates an LLM provider to produce text completions. The abstraction can be found in [`rag.py`](r2r/core/pipelines/rag.py).

Each pipeline incorporates a logging database for operation tracking and observability.
