"""
Some testing ideas to implement:
create valid circuit [should pass]
attempt to create valid circuit [should fail]
add valid gate to circuit [pass/fail]
add invalid (not sure what this would be just yet) gate to circuit [fail]
add multiple gates to circuit [pass]
add large number of gates to circuit [pass]
can be printed [small/large]
valid circuit can be decomposed into gate(s) [pass]
empty circuit can be decomposed into gate(s) [fail?]
