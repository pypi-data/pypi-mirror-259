### DESCRIPTIONS

- `cgpt` is a Python package that allows you to use AI directly in your favorite Terminal.
- `cgpt` is based on [CLICK](https://github.com/pallets/click) for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way.

### :question: REQUIREMENTS

- python >=3.7
- openai API KEY :
  You need to register on openai to receive your own api key , here : [api_key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### INSTALL FROM PYPI

You can install the latest version from pypi.

```
pip install cgpt
```

### üñ•Ô∏è SETUP FOR DEVELOPPERS

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üî® BUILD

- For this part , it is better to use Linux.

If you are on Linux , launch:

```
sudo chmod +x build.sh
```

Then , :

```
./build.sh
```

### ‚èØÔ∏è VERIFY INSTALLATION

```
cgpt-version
```

### üöÄ RUN

```
cgpt
```

### :link: CGPT INSIDE A LOCAL NETWORK

You can use cgpt inside a LAN.

- You just need one Host (`connected to internet`) to be the server.
- Other Hosts (`not connected to internet`) can ALWAYS use Chat GPT as `client`.

NOTES :

- For now , a server must be launched inside a `Linux` computer . If the server is inside `Windows` : the address is sometimes wrong (to be fixed in the next version).

- Also , make sure that your `/etc/hosts` is configured correctly like :

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	your-hostanme
```

- A `client` can also use his own api_key in the next version.

### :whale2: BUILD AND RUN WITH DOCKER

- To make it easier , use the `docker-compose.yml` file :

```
docker-compose run --rm app
```
