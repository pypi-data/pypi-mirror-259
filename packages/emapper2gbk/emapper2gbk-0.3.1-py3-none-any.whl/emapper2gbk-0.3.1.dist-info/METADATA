emapper2gbk: creation of genbank files from Eggnog-mapper annotation outputs
============================================================================

Starting from fasta and `Eggnog-mapper <http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/>`__ annotation files, build a gbk file that is suitable for metabolic network reconstruction with `Pathway Tools <http://bioinformatics.ai.sri.com/ptools/>`__. Adds the GO terms and EC numbers annotations in the genbank file.
There are two main modes:

* **genes mode**: suitable when a list of isolated genes/proteins have been annotated with Eggnog-mapper, typically the gene catalogue of a metagenome.

* **genomes mode**: usually when focusing on a single organism, with a ``.gff`` file. The creation of genbanks can be performed in parallel by providing directories (with matching names for genomes, proteomes and annotation files) as inputs.

**If you use emapper2gbk, please cite**

Main inputs
-----------

emapper2gbk genes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each annotated list of genes, inputs are:

* a nucleotide fasta file containing the CDS sequence of each genes or a folder containing multiple nucleotide fasta files.
* the translated sequences in amino-acids in fasta or a folder containing the corresponding protein sequences to the nucleotide sequences (must be the same name).
* the annotation file obtained after Eggnog-mapper annotation (usually ``xxx.emapper.annotation``) or a folder with multiple annotation files (must be the same name as nucleotide fasta file and ends with '.tsv' extension).

In addition, as optional files:

* the name of the considered organism (can be "bacteria" or "metagenome") or a file with organisms names (matching the genomes names).
* the merge option to merge genes into fake contigs.
* the number of available cores for multiprocessing (when working on multiple genomes).
* a go-basic file of GO ontology (if not given, emapper2gbk will download a copy and use it).

Example:

Input with files:

.. code-block:: text

    nucleotide_sequences.fna
    protein_sequence.faa
    annotation.emapper.annotation

Input with folders:

.. code-block:: text

    nucleotide_sequences
    ├── gene_list_1.fna
    ├── gene_list_2.fna
    protein_sequence
    ├── gene_list_1.faa
    ├── gene_list_2.faa
    annotation
    ├── gene_list_1.tsv
    ├── gene_list_2.tsv

.. image:: pictures/emapper2gbk_genes.svg

To work the ID of the genes in the nucleic fasta file (``-fn``) must be the same than the ID of the proteins in the protein fasta file (``-fp``) and in the annotation file (``-a``).

emapper2gbk genomes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each genomes, inputs are:

* a nucleotide fasta file containing the sequence of each contigs/chromosomes for the genome or a folder containing multiple nucleotide fasta files.
* the proteome corresponding to the genome or a folder containing the corresponding protein sequences to the nucleotide sequences (having the same name as the nucleotides files).
* the GFF file corresponding to the genome or a folder containing multiple GFF files (each GFF files must have the same name as the corresponding nucleotide files).
* the annotation file obtained after Eggnog-mapper annotation (usually ``xxx.emapper.annotation``) or a folder with multiple annotation files (must be the same name as nucleotide fasta file and ends with '.tsv' extension)

In addition, as optional files:

* the name of the considered organism (can be "bacteria") or a file with organisms names (matching the genomes names).
* the number of available cores for multiprocessing (when working on multiple genomes).
* a go-basic file of GO ontology (if not given, emapper2gbk will download a copy and use it).

Example:

Input with files:

.. code-block:: text

    nucleotide_sequences.fna
    protein_sequence.faa
    annotation.emapper.annotation
    genome.gff

Input with folders:

.. code-block:: text

    nucleotide_sequences
    ├── genome_1.fna
    ├── genome_2.fna
    protein_sequence
    ├── genome_1.faa
    ├── genome_2.faa
    annotation
    ├── genome_1.tsv
    ├── genome_2.tsv
    gff
    ├── genome_1.gff
    ├── genome_2.gff

.. image:: pictures/emapper2gbk_genomes.svg

The ID in the chromosome/contigs/scaffolds fasta file (``-fn``) must correspond to region in the gff file (``-g``).
Then the genes in the region will be found and the child CDS associated to the genes wil be extracted.
The CDS ID must be the same than the ID in the protein fasta file (``-fp``) and the ID in the eggnog-mapper annotation file (``-a``).


By default emapper2gbk searches for inheritance between genes and CDS in the GFF files.
A gene feature is required and the CDS feature must have the gene feature as a parent, like in this example:

.. code-block:: text

    ##gff file
    region_1	RefSeq	region	1	12642	.	+	.	ID=region_1
    region_1	RefSeq	gene	1	2445	.	-	.	ID=gene_1
    region_1	RefSeq	CDS	1	2445	.	-	0	ID=cds_1;Parent=gene_1

Depending on which field (CDS, mRNA or gene) of the gff is associated with the proteome IDs in faa file, the gff-type (``-gt``) option can take into account these 3 parameters (``CDS``, ``mRNA``, ``gene``).
The tool also takes into account particular gff formats (Gmove and eggnog) and the gff-type option (``-gt``) can take these 2 parameters (``gmove``, ``eggnog``).

**CDS gff type**

For example, some GFF files can be formatted differently with only CDS (such as in `Prodigal <https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal>`__ or `Prokka <https://github.com/tseemann/prokka>`__ GFF), it is possible to use them with ``-gt CDS`` (case sensitive).
Here is an example of the format accepted by this command (with ID cds_1 being the same as the one in the faa and eggnogg-mapper files):

.. code-block:: text

    ##gff file
    region_1	RefSeq	CDS	1	2445	.	-	0	ID=cds_1

**mRNA gff type**

The ``-gt mRNA`` option (case sensitive) is to be used in case the protein identifiers in the faa file match the identifiers in the "mRNA" field of the gff.
Here is an example of the format accepted by this command (with ID cds_1 being the same as the one in the faa and eggnogg-mapper files):

.. code-block:: text

    ##gff file
    region_1	RefSeq	mRNA	1	2445	.	-	0	ID=cds_1


It is useful for gff formats containing multiple "CDS" fields associated with 1 gene and/or 1 mRNA and a single sequence in the faa file.

**gene gff type**

The ``-gt gene`` option is to be used in case the protein identifiers in the faa file match the identifiers in the "gene" field of the gff.
Here is an example of the format accepted by this command (with ID cds_1 being the same as the one in the faa and eggnogg-mapper files):

.. code-block:: text

    ##gff file
    region_1	RefSeq	gene	1	2445	.	-	0	ID=cds_1


**Gmove gff type**

The tool handle GFF from `Gmove <https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/gmove/>`__ (with ``-gt gmove``) with the following format:

.. code-block:: text

    ##gff file
    region_1	Gmove	mRNA	1	2445	.	+	.	ID=mRNA_gene_1;Name=mRNA_gene_1
    region_1	Gmove	CDS	1	2445	.	-	0	Parent=mRNA_gene_1

For gmove, the proteins in the faa and eggnogg-mapper files will be prefixed with ``prot_`` (like ``prot_gene_1`` for ``mRNA_gene_1``). Emapper2gbk should be able to handle these differences.

**EggNog gff type**

It is also possible to use the GFF created by eggnog-mapper (if a fasta genome was given as input to eggnog-mapper) with ``-gt eggnog``.
An example of such use can be seen in the `test folder <https://github.com/AuReMe/emapper2gbk/tree/master/tests/test_data/data_eggnog>`__.

.. code-block:: sh

    usage: emapper2gbk [-h] [-v] {genes,genomes} ...

    Starting from fasta and Eggnog-mapper annotation files, build a gbk file that is suitable for metabolic network reconstruction with Pathway Tools. Adds the GO terms and EC numbers annotations in the genbank file.

    Two modes:
    - genomes (one genome/proteome/gff/annot file --> one gbk).
    - genes with the annotation of the full gene catalogue and fasta files (nucleic and protein) corresponding to list of genes.

    Examples:

    * Genomic - single mode

    emapper2gbk genomes -fn genome.fna -fp proteome.faa -gff genome.gff -n "Escherichia coli" -o coli.gbk -a eggnog_annotation.tsv [-go go-basic.obo]

    * Genomic - multiple mode, "bacteria" as default name

    emapper2gbk genes -fn genome_dir/ -fp proteome_dir/ -n metagenome -o gbk_dir/ -a eggnog_annotation_dir/ [-go go-basic.obo]

    * Genomic - multiple mode, tsv file for organism names

    emapper2gbk genes -fn genome_dir/ -fp proteome_dir/ -nf matching_genome_orgnames.tsv -o gbk_dir/ -a eggnog_annotation_dir/ [-go go-basic.obo]

    * Metagenomic

    emapper2gbk genes -fn genome_dir/ -fp proteome_dir/ -o gbk_dir/ -a gene_cat_ggnog_annotation.tsv --one-annot-file [-go go-basic.obo]

    You can give the GO ontology as an input to the program, it will be otherwise downloaded during the run. You can download it here: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/go-basic.obo .
    The program requests the NCBI database to retrieve taxonomic information of the organism. However, if the organism is "bacteria" or "metagenome", the taxonomic information will not have to be retrieved online.
    Hence, if you need to run the program from a cluster with no internet access, it is possible for a "bacteria" or "metagenome" organism, and by providing the GO-basic.obo file.
