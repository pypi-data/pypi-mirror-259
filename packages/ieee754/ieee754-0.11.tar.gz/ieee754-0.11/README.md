# ieee754

ieee754 is a Python module which finds the IEEE-754 representation of a floating point number. You can specify a precision given in the list below or you can even use your own custom precision.
<ul>
    <li>Half Precision (16 bit: 1 bit for sign + 5 bits for exponent + 10 bits for mantissa)</li>
    <li>Single Precision (32 bit: 1 bit for sign + 8 bits for exponent + 23 bits for mantissa)</li>
    <li>Double Precision (64 bit: 1 bit for sign + 11 bits for exponent + 52 bits for mantissa)</li>
    <li>Quadruple Precision (128 bit: 1 bit for sign + 15 bits for exponent + 112 bits for mantissa)</li>
    <li>Octuple Precision (256 bit: 1 bit for sign + 19 bits for exponent + 236 bits for mantissa)</li>
</ul>

## Prerequisites

ieee754 does not require any external libraries or modules.

## Installing

To download ieee754, either fork this github repo or simply use Pypi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install ieee754
```

## Using

After installation, you can import ieee754 and use it in your projects.

### Simplest Example

The simplest example is to use the desired precision IEEE-754 representation of a floating point number. You can import the desired precision from ieee754 and use it like this. The available precisions are `half`, `single`, `double`, `quadruple` and `octuple`.
```Python
from ieee754 import double

print(double(13.375))
```

### Default Options

Default precision is Double Precision and you can get the output by just calling the instance as a string.
```Python
from ieee754 import IEEE754

x = 13.375
a = IEEE754(x)
# you should call the instance as a string
print(a)
print(str(a))
print(f"{a}")
# you can get the hexadecimal presentation like this
print(a.hex())
# you can get more detailed information like this
print(a.json())
```

### Select a Precision

You can use Half (p=0), Single (p=1), Double (p=2), Quadrupole (p=3) or Octuple precision (p=4).
```Python
from ieee754 import IEEE754

for p in range(5):
    a = IEEE754(x, p)
    print("x = %f | b = %s | h = %s" % (13.375, a, a.hex()))
```

### Use the Precision Name as an Interface

You can use the precision name as an interface to get the IEEE-754 representation of a floating point number. With this method you can get the IEEE-754 representation of a floating point number without creating an instance.
```Python
from ieee754 import half, single, double, quadruple, octuple

x = 13.375
print(half(x))
print(single(x))
print(double(x))
print(quadruple(x))
print(octuple(x))
```

### Using a Custom Precision

You can force exponent, and mantissa size by using `force_exponent` and `force_mantissa` parameters to create your own custom precision.
```Python
a = IEEE754(x, force_exponent=6, force_mantissa=12)
print(a)
```

### Finding the Error of a Floating Point Number

You can find the error of a floating point number by using the `converted_number` and `error` properties of the class.
```Python
x = 8.7
a = IEEE754(x, 1)
print(f"{x} is converted as {a.converted_number} Â± {a.error}")
```
