# Winfetch-py
A simplistic, yet beautiful system info fetcher that is made for windows that runs in the command line, written entirely in python.


# Features
- Date and time written neatly in the same program
- Coloured output
- Detects and prints out your GPU (With support for multiple GPUs!)
- Detects and prints out your CPU (Also prints the amount of cores!)
- Theme support (See contributing so you can add your favorite themes to the project!)


# Installation
Currently, I have not packaged winfetch-py for PyPI, so you can't install winfetch through pip just yet, but look out for it in the coming days!
Please note that winfetch-py is only supported on windows.

## 1. Clone
    git clone https://github.com/Warrobot10/Winfetch.git

## 2. Navigate
    cd Winfetch

# Contributing
The themes are found in ``themes.json``

Tinker with some colour combinations in themes.json, find some that looks good, and then make a pull request so everyone who uses Winfetch-py can enjoy your theme!
