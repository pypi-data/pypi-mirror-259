Multiple features often represent the same metabolite due to isotopologues, adduct, multiple charges etc. and thus, the number of features is only a rough proxy for the number of detected metabolites. Due to noise, artifacts, rare metabolites, etc. the number of features often increases with the number of samples."

Each empirical compound is a khipu, thus, the number of khipus is an estimateof the number of detected metabolites. Each khipu represents multiple features; however, unless singletons were added to the khipu during construction, the number of features grouped captured by empCpds is less thanthe number of features."
