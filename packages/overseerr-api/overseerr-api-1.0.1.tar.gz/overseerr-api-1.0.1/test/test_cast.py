    Overseerr API

    This is the documentation for the Overseerr API backend.  Two primary authentication methods are supported:  - **Cookie Authentication**: A valid sign-in to the `/auth/plex` or `/auth/local` will generate a valid authentication cookie. - **API Key Authentication**: Sign-in is also possible by passing an `X-Api-Key` header along with a valid API Key generated by Overseerr. 

    The version of the OpenAPI document: 1.0.0
    Generated by OpenAPI Generator (https://openapi-generator.tech)
