![Adaptive Models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dream-faster/fold/main/docs/images/overview_diagrams/main_diagram.svg)

The<b> <a href="https://dream-faster.github.io/fold/concepts/adaptive-ml/">Adaptive ML Engine</a></b> that lets you <b>build</b>, <b>deploy and update</b> Models easily. An order of magnitude speed-up, combined with flexibility and rigour.</b>

![Fold works with many third party libraries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dream-faster/fold/main/docs/images/overview_diagrams/third_party.svg)

## Main Features

![Fold's main features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dream-faster/fold/main/docs/images/overview_diagrams/main_features.svg)

- 10x faster Adaptive Backtesting - [What does that mean?](https://dream-faster.github.io/fold/concepts/adaptive-ml/)
- Composite Models made Adaptive - [What does that mean?](https://dream-faster.github.io/fold/concepts/adaptive-ml/)
- Distributed computing - [Why is this important?](#Fold-is-different)
- Update deployed models (coming in May) - [Why is this important?](#Fold-is-different)


## Installation

- Prerequisites: `python >= 3.8` and `pip`

- Install from pypi:
  ```
  pip install fold-core
  ```

## Quickstart

You can quickly train your chosen models and get predictions by running:

```py
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from statsforecast.models import ARIMA
from fold import ExpandingWindowSplitter, train_evaluate
from fold.composites import Ensemble
from fold.transformations import OnlyPredictions
from fold.utils.dataset import get_preprocessed_dataset

X, y = get_preprocessed_dataset(
    "weather/historical_hourly_la", target_col="temperature", shorten=1000
)

pipeline = [
    Ensemble(
        [
            RandomForestRegressor(),
            ARIMA(order=(1, 1, 0)),
        ]
    ),
    OnlyPredictions(),
]
splitter = ExpandingWindowSplitter(initial_train_window=0.2, step=0.2)
scorecard, prediction, trained_pipelines, _, _ = train_evaluate(pipeline, X, y, splitter)
```


(If you install `krisi` by running `pip install krisi` you get an extended report back, rather than a single metric.)

## Fold is different

- Adaptive Models and Backtesting at lightning speed.<br/>
  <span style="color:orange;">**‚Üí fold allows to simulate and evaluate your models like they would have performed, in reality/when deployed, with clever use of paralellization and design.**</span>

- Create composite models: ensembles, hybrids, stacking pipelines, easily.<br/>
  <span style="color:orange;">**‚Üí Underutilized, but [the easiest, fastest way to increase performance of your Time Series models.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169207022001480)**
  </span>

- Built with Distributed Computing in mind.<br/>
  <span style="color:orange;">**‚Üí Deploy your research and development pipelines to a cluster with `ray`, and use `modin` to handle out-of-memory datasets (full support for modin is coming in April).**</span>

- Bridging the gap between Online and Mini-Batch learning.<br/>
  <span style="color:orange;">**‚Üí Mix and match `xgboost` with ARIMA, in a single pipeline. Boost your model's accuracy by updating them on every timestamp, if desired.**</span>

- Update your deployed models, easily, as new data flows in.<br/>
  <span style="color:orange;">**‚Üí Real world is not static. Let your models adapt, without the need to re-train from scratch.**</span>

## What is Adaptive Backtesting?

![Adaptive Backtesting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dream-faster/fold/main/docs/images/technical_diagrams/continous_validation.svg)

It's like classical Backtesting / Time Series Cross-Validation, plus: Inside a test window, and during deployment, fold provides a way for models to update their parameters or access the last value.

## Licence & Usage

We want to **bring much-needed transparency, speed and rigour** to the process of creating Time Series ML pipelines, while also building a sustainable business, that can support the ecosystem in the long-term.
Fold's licence is inbetween [source-available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) and a traditional commercial software licence. It requires a paid licence for any commercial use, after the initial, 30 day trial period.

We also want to contribute to open research by giving free access to non-commercial, research use of `fold`.

## Limitations

- No intermittent time series support, very limited support for missing values.
- No hierarchical time series support.
