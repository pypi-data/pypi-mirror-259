Product Purpose
Create a database of supplier products for the needs of enterprise purchasing departments.
Provide a convenient and efficient trading platform for both suppliers and
consumers. For suppliers, our goal is to provide a flexible system for implementation and
promotion of their products, including commodity import of price lists and catalogs for trade
platform. For consumers, we strive to create an intuitive and convenient
an interface that will allow you to quickly select the necessary products as in manual mode,
and by automatic scripts through the “load specification” function, carry out
convenient sorting in the results of issuing goods.
Internal algorithms will take into account various aspects: supplier company rating,
which is taken from counterparty verification services. And also the ability to manually set
this rating by the administrator, the cost of the goods offered, comparison of terms and
shipping costs to provide consumers with the most useful information
to make the final decision to purchase a particular product.
The ultimate goal of creating this product is to create a universal platform,
which will facilitate efficient trade and interaction between the supplier and
by the consumer in a semi-automatic scenario, providing convenience and safety as
for suppliers and consumers. We strive to ensure that our application
has become a reliable tool for supplier businesses, allowing them to conveniently manage
with your products and increase your customer base. At the same time, we want
provide consumers with access to a wide selection of products and the ability to quickly and
it is convenient to find the best options taking into account various parameters, such as
supplier reliability, prices and delivery conditions. We want to create a platform that
will be beneficial and useful for all its participants, promoting business development and facilitating
the process of buying (purchasing departments) and selling goods (to sales managers).

- It is important to provide protection against DDoS attacks and SQL injections.
Reliability
1. Architecture: The application must be built in such a way that it effectively
process a large number of requests. This can be achieved using micro
service architecture, which allows you to divide the application into many
independent services working together.
2. Speed and performance: to ensure high speed and
application performance requires the use of efficient algorithms and
performance optimization techniques such as caching, using CDN and
database optimization.
3. Scalability: The application must be ready to scale in order to
cope with increased load.
Work roadmap
Release development of this software is expected, which means that
releases will go from smaller to larger, for example in the first release
directly the application base with the minimum necessary functions for
use, and later individual components are added to the database,
improving and expanding functionality.
Preliminary terms and prices are indicated taking into account software development by 2 programmers
It is impossible to calculate the exact cost for such a large project.
