This package is provides parameter optimization for PyBaMM (Python Battery Mathematical Modelling) using different optimization techniques. Examples on how to run this package can be found in the [examples folder](./examples)

## üöÄ Installing pybamm-param

### Using pip
The recommended way to install pybamm-param is by installing the latest release from PyPI. This can be done running
```bash
pip install pbparam
```
We strongly recommend using virtual environments, see more detailed instructions below (steps 1 and 2).

### Install from source

Another option is to install from source. This is not recommended, unless you want to make edits to the code.

The first step is to install `virtualenv` in order to create virtual environments

```bash
pip install virtualenv
```

The module dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`, the dependancies which are non optional which are installed with the package.

The optional dependancies are split into `dev` and `docs`. `dev` are used for testing and linting, `docs` are used for building the sphinx documentation. 

#### Linux & MacOS

1. Create a virtual environment (this is strongly recommended to avoid clashes with the dependencies)

    ```bash
    virtualenv --python="<path to python 3.11>" env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

    The virtual environment can later be deactivated (if needed) by running

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

3. Install packages into the virtual envronment

    ```bash
    pip install -e ./[dev,docs]
    ```

#### Windows

1. Create a virtual environment (this is strongly recommended to avoid clashes with the dependencies)

    ```bash
    python -m virtualenv env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

    ```bash
    env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    The virtual environment can later be deactivated (if needed) by running

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

3. Install package from Github

    ```bash
    pip install -e .\\[dev,docs]
    ```
