# Abmarl

Abmarl is a package for developing Agent-Based Simulations and training them with
MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We provide an intuitive command line
interface for engaging with the full workflow of MARL experimentation: training,
visualizing, and analyzing agent behavior. We define an Agent-Based Simulation
Interface and Simulation Manager, which control which agents interact with the
simulation at each step. We support integration with popular reinforcement learning
simulation interfaces, including gym.Env, MultiAgentEnv, and OpenSpiel. We define
our own GridWorld Simulation Framework for creating custom grid-based Agent Based
Simulations.

Abmarl leverages RLlibâ€™s framework for reinforcement learning and extends it to
more easily support custom simulations, algorithms, and policies. We enable researchers to rapidly
prototype MARL experiments and simulation design and lower the barrier for pre-existing
projects to prototype RL as a potential solution.

## Quickstart

To use Abmarl, install via pip: `pip install abmarl`

To develop Abmarl, clone the repository and install via pip's development mode.

```
git clone git@github.com:LLNL/Abmarl.git
cd abmarl
pip install -r requirements/requirements_all.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

Train agents in a multicorridor simulation:
```
abmarl train examples/multi_corridor_example.py
```

Visualize trained behavior:
```
abmarl visualize ~/abmarl_results/MultiCorridor-2020-08-25_09-30/ -n 5 --record
```

Note: If you install with `conda,` then you must also include `ffmpeg` in your
virtual environment.
