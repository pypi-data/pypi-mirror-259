# GCPDS - Documentation Guide

Welcome to the "GCPDS - Documentation Guide", a comprehensive manual for establishing, configuring, and sustaining project documentation within the **Grupo de Control y Procesamiento Digital de Se√±ales ([GCPDS](https://github.com/UN-GCPDS))** initiative. Our objective is to unify documentation practices across various modules and projects, thereby enhancing clarity, accessibility, and practicality.

This guide delineates a sequence of steps and best practices aimed at facilitating the seamless integration of Python modules with version control and automated documentation systems. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining exemplary code management and documentation standards, which are essential for collaborative development and the enduring success of our projects.

Key topics include the initial setup of a GitHub repository, encompassing naming conventions and configuration, and extending to automated documentation generation via [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/). The guide also addresses security protocols, focusing on safeguarding sensitive data with repository secrets and access tokens to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our projects.

Each section is meticulously crafted to guide you through the steps necessary for achieving an efficient and secure workflow. By following these guidelines, the GCPDS community will significantly contribute to a resilient and enduring research and development ecosystem in digital signal processing and control.

## Introduction to Setting Up and Integrating a Python Module Repository

This documentation provides a structured approach to setting up a Python module repository on GitHub and integrating it with external documentation and automation services. The objective is to streamline the process of repository management, code security, and documentation generation for Python projects. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure their projects are well-organized, secure, and easily maintainable.

### Objectives

1. **Establish Conventions**: Define a clear and descriptive naming convention for Python module repositories to maintain consistency and clarity across projects.
   
2. **Secure Configuration**: Implement repository variables and secrets to manage environment configurations and sensitive information securely.
   
3. **Access Management**: Generate a Personal Access Token (Classic) to provide secure access to GitHub resources, enabling automated processes and integrations.
   
4. **Documentation Automation**: Create and configure a project on Read the Docs to facilitate automatic generation and hosting of project documentation.
   
5. **Continuous Integration**: Set up webhooks between GitHub and Read the Docs to enable real-time documentation updates with each code commit, ensuring the latest project changes are always documented.

By adhering to these steps, we aim to create a robust workflow that encapsulates best practices for repository setup, security, and documentation, while also leveraging automation to reduce manual effort and potential errors.

### Steps Overview

- **Guidelines for Python Module Repository Naming and Configuration on GitHub**: This section will guide you through the best practices for naming your Python module repository, setting it to public, and choosing the appropriate license.

- **Configuring Repository Variables and Secrets on GitHub**: Here, you will learn how to securely store and manage environment-specific configurations within your GitHub repository settings.

- **Creating a Personal Access Token (Classic) on GitHub**: This part of the documentation explains the process of creating a Personal Access Token to interact with GitHub's API securely.

- **Creating a Project on Read the Docs**: We will go through the steps of setting up your project on Read the Docs, ensuring your documentation is automatically generated from your repository.

- **Integrating GitHub with Webhooks for Read the Docs**: Lastly, you will set up a webhook to connect your GitHub repository with Read the Docs, allowing for automated documentation builds upon every commit.

Following these guidelines will set a solid foundation for your Python projects on GitHub and ensure that your documentation is always up-to-date with your latest code changes.
