# Topic Reference Unified Schema: `torus`



TOpic Reference Index (TORI)

TORI is a general scheme for tracking references and metadata. Implemented as an abstract specification, the TORI scheme allows for the underlying data to be stored in human-readable formats such as TOML, YAML, and JSON. The python utilities in the pytori package provide both an object-relational mapping for TORI scheme elements as well as a set of tools for validation of scheme elements.

TORI Scheme

The TORI scheme consists of two principle elements: Reference and Tag. Each element has both attributes, which are pieces of metadata associated to a particular instance, as well as properties, which apply to collecitons of elements. For example, a particular Tag must have name and description attributes, while it must have the property of uniqueness with respect to a collection of Tag elements.

The Reference Element

The Reference element is the primary data element in the TORI scheme. It represents a source of information, such as a journal article, book, presentation, or other document. A Reference has the following features.

Attributes

The Reference element has the following attributes:

title [required] (string)
The Tag Element

The Tag element is the primary metadata element in the TORI scheme

The TagGroup Element

The TagGroup element

Python Implementation

The included pytori python package contains utilities for reading, writing, validating, and interacting with data in the TORI scheme.
