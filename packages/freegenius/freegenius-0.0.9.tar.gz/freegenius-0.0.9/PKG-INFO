# FreeGenius AI

FreeGenius AI is an ambitious project sparked by the pioneering work of [LetMeDoIt AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit). It's designed with the primary objective of offering a comprehensive suite of AI solutions that mirror the capabilities of [LetMeDoIt AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit). However, FreeGenius AI is remarkably different in that all core features are completely free, and it doesn't require the use of an OpenAI key.

As with [LetMeDoIt AI](https://github.com/eliranwong/letmedoit), FreeGenius AI is designed to be capable of engaging in intuitive conversations, executing codes, providing up-to-date information, and performing
a wide range of tasks. It's designed to learn, adapt, and grow with the user, offering personalized experiences and interactions.
