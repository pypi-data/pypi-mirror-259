This module ({module}) requires following credentials: {','.join(credentials)}.

Could not find credentials: {','.join(missing_credentials)}.

The user should provide those credentials, explain to them how to do it, and what they are.
Don't use 'getpass' or anything that reads from the console, ask them using text,
When they provide you with credentials, save the credentials for the user, using the following code:

from aiconsole_toolkit.credentials import save_credential
save_credential("{module}", "{missing_credentials[0]}", your_value)
    ...
        """.strip()
        )
