Prompting with V6 is significantly different than V5. You will need to ‘relearn’ how to prompt. V6 is much more sensitive to your prompt. Avoid 'junk' like 'award winning, photorealistic, 4k, 8k'. Be explicit about what you want. It may be less vibey but if you are explicit it’s now much better at understanding you. If you want something more photographic / less opinionated / more literal you should probably default to using --style raw. Lower values of --stylize (default 100) may have better prompt understanding while higher values (up to 1000) may have better aesthetics.

When it comes to text prompting, there is no single right or wrong way to do it. But generally, my prompts follow a similar structure:

(Medium) (Style) (Scene) (Action) (Modulate) (Parameters)

Medium: Cinematic Film, 3D Animation, 2D Animation, etc.
Style/Composition: Action Film, Drama Film, Style by (filmmaker)
Scene: Who is your subject? Where are they located?
Modulate: Are there external effects, rain? Fog?

Midjourney now allows for prompting text within an image. However, like most AI image generators, your results may vary. To prompt for text, use quotation marks in your prompt.

Currently supported:
--ar, --chaos, --weird, --tile, --stylize, --style raw, vary (subtle), vary (strong), remix, / blend, /describe (just the V5 version)

Currently unsupported:
Pan, zoom, vary (region), /tune, /describe (a new V6 version)

To note: Although we do not currently have features such as inpainting (vary region), the 'vary subtle' and 'vary strong' features are tremendously more coherent in V6. On the right, is:
'Illustration, style by blue and yellow, a motorcycle in the forest --ar 16:9'
And on the left is the result of a 'vary subtle', simply changing 'motorcycle' to 'van.'

Example prompts:
Photograph, man in a blue business suit, walking down a busy city street, facing camera --ar 16:9
Photograph, style by cyberpunk, woman with long white hair and combat armor, city alley, autumn colors, fall day --ar 16:9
Cinematic scene, dramatic film, close up, a young fisherman on a boat and a young woman look longingly at one another, in love, northeast US, rain falling  --ar 2:1 --v 6.0 --stylize 50
Cinematic still, ultra wide angle, Godzilla rampaging through a modern city, building destruction, people running, kaiju chaos --ar 16:9
Movie poster, 80s sci-fi horror, space, Ridley Scott, 'The Inhuman' --ar 2:3
A copy of Stephen King’s 'The Gunslinger', sits on a table.
Beautiful woman, graphic design, 'like and subscribe'::4 --ar 2:1
A highly detailed 3D render of a double handed sword isolated on a white background as an RPG game asset, unreal engine, ray tracing --ar 2:3

As a note: Please experiment with different prompt ideas. Stellar results can occur with both minimal text and long-form descriptions. Prompt formulas are a guide, never a law.
