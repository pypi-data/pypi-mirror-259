# Battle Map TV

Display battle maps for TTRPGs on a tv that lies flat horizontally on your table.

This Python application aims to do one thing: quickly show an image on your secondary screen,
in the right size and with a 1-inch grid.

For GM's with little time or who improvise their sessions: much easier to use in-session than a full blown VTT.

## Features
- Works on Linux, macOS and Windows by using Python.
- Doesn't use a browser.
- Free and open source
- Works offline
- Simple UI
- Two windows:
  - one on the TV with your map and grid on it
  - one on your GM laptop with controls
- Import local image files to display on the tv.
- Scale, pan and rotate the image.
- Store the physical size of your screen to enable grid and autoscaling.
- Overlay a 1-inch grid.
- Automatically detect the grid in an image and scale to a 1 inch grid.
- Save settings so images load like you had them last time.
- Simple initiative tracker


## Installation

- Open terminal or cmd.
- Check that you have Python installed by running the `python --version` command.
  - If you don't have Python, it's easy to install. See here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download
- Install Battle Map TV with this command: `python -m pip install battle-map-tv`
- Then run it with: `python -m battle_map_tv`


## Manual

- Drag the TV window to your TV and make it fullscreen with the 'fullscreen' button.
- Ue the 'add' button to load an image.
- You can drag the image to pan. Zoom with your mouse scroll wheel or use the slider in the controls window.
- Close the application with the 'exit' button.

### Set screen size

There are two text boxes to enter the physical dimensions of your secondary screen in milimeters.
This is needed to display a grid overlay and autoscale the image to 1 inch.

### Initiative tracker

In the controls window, you can add players and their initiative. The list will be sorted automatically.
Just put a number and a name on each line.

The '+' and '-' buttons increase and decrease the font size.


## Technical

- Uses [PySide6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) for the graphical user interface.
- Uses [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-python) to detect the grid on battle maps.
- Uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) to build and release the package.
