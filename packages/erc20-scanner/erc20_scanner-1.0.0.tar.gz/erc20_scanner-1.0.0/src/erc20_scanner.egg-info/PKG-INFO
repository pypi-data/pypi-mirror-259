# ERC20 Scanner
Reference implementation of ERC20 mnemonics: mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys.

# Abstract
This BIP describes the implementation of a mnemonic code or mnemonic sentence – a group of easy to remember words – for the generation of deterministic wallets.

It consists of two parts: generating the mnenomic, and converting it into a binary seed. This seed can be later used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-39 or similar methods.

# Installation
To install this library and its dependencies use:

```
pip install erc20_scanner
```
