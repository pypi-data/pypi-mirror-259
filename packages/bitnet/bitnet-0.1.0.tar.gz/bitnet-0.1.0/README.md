# BitNet
![bitnet](/bitnet.png)
Implementation of the "BitNet: Scaling 1-bit Transformers for Large Language Models"

[Paper link:](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.11453.pdf)

BitLinear = tensor -> layernorm -> Binarize -> abs max quantization -> dequant

"The implementation of the BitNet architecture is quite simple, requiring only the replacement of linear projections (i.e., nn.Linear in PyTorch) in the Transformer. " -- BitNet is really easy to implement just swap out the linears with the BitLinear modules! 

## **NEWS**
- BitNet Transformer has been trained using the `train.py` file that trains on enwiki8 a small 1gb dataset of wikipedia: [HERE IS THE LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gBuZRFBqMV3cVD902LXA_hmZl4e0dLyY/view)

## Appreciation
- Dimitry, Nullonix for analysis and code review and revision
- Vyom, for providing 4080 to train!

## Installation
`pip install bitnet`

## Usage:

### `BitLinear`
- Example of the BitLinear layer which is the main innovation of the paper!
```python
import torch

from bitnet import BitLinear

# Input
x = torch.randn(10, 512)

# BitLinear layer
layer = BitLinear(512, 400)

# Output
y = layer(x)

print(y)

```
----

### `BitNetTransformer`
- Fully implemented Transformer as described in the diagram with MHA, and BitFeedforwards
- Can be utilized not just for text but for images and maybe even video or audio processing
- Complete with residuals and skip connections for gradient flow

```python
import torch
from bitnet import BitNetTransformer

bitnet = BitNetTransformer(
    num_tokens=20000,
    dim=512,
    depth=6,
    dim_head=64,
    heads=8,
    ff_mult=4,
)

tokens = torch.randint(0, 20000, (1, 512))
logits = bitnet(tokens)
print(logits.shape)

```

### `BitFeedForward`
- Feedforward as shown in the diagram with BitLinear and a GELU:
- Linear -> GELU -> Linear
- You can add dropouts, or layernorms, or other layers for a better ffn

```python
import torch
from bitnet.bitffn import BitFeedForward

# Random input
x = torch.randn(10, 512)

# FFN
ff = BitFeedForward(512)

# Apply FFN
y = ff(x)

print(y.shape)
# torch.Size([10, 512])
```

## Inference
```python
from bitnet import BitNetInference

bitnet = BitNetInference()
bitnet.load_model('../model_checkpoint.pth') #Download model
output_str = bitnet.generate("The dog jumped over the ", 512)
print(output_str)

```

# Todo
- [x] Double check BitLinear implementation and make sure it works exactly as in paper 
- [x] Implement training script for `BitNetTransformer`
- [x] Train on Enwiki8, copy and past code and data from Lucidrains repos
- [x] Benchmark performance
- [x] Look into Straight Through Estimator for non-differentiable backprop
- [x] Implement BitFeedForward
- [x] Clean up codebase 
- [x] Add unit tests for each module
