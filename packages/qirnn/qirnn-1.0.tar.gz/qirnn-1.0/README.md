# Quantum-Inspired Recursive Neural Network (QIRNN)

## Introduction

The Quantum-Inspired Recursive Neural Network (QIRNN) is a novel architecture inspired by principles from quantum computing and neural networks. This README provides an overview of the QIRNN implementation and its key components.

## Components

### QuantumAdaptiveComputationTime

The `QuantumAdaptiveComputationTime` module implements an adaptive computation time mechanism to dynamically adjust the number of processing steps based on the input data. It utilizes an RNN-based mechanism to determine when to halt processing for each input sequence.

### QIRNN_Adaptive

The `QIRNN_Adaptive` module represents the core architecture of the Quantum-Inspired Recursive Neural Network with Adaptive Computation Time. It consists of several key components:

- **QuantumEmbedding**: Embedding layer for input sequences.
- **QuantumLayerEfficient**: Efficient quantum layer for processing quantum states.
- **QuantumSelfAttention**: Self-attention mechanism inspired by quantum principles.
- **QuantumDynamicRouting**: Dynamic routing mechanism for information flow.
- **QuantumAdaptiveComputationTime**: Adaptive computation time mechanism described above.
- **QuantumLayerNorm**: Layer normalization for quantum layers.
- **QuantumGate**: Gate mechanism for controlling quantum state transformations.
- **RecursiveCollapse**: Recursive collapse operation for output aggregation.
- **Linear**: Linear transformation for final output projection.

## Usage

```python
# Example usage of the adaptive model
model_adaptive = QIRNN_Adaptive(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, output_dim, heads, routing_iterations=3, stabilization_factor=0.1, max_steps=10)
output_adaptive = model_adaptive(x)
print(output_adaptive)
```
