This repository implements a causal feature selection algorithm based on transfer entropy. The algorithm is described in: Bonetti, P., Metelli, A. M., & Restelli, M. (2023, October 17). Causal Feature Selection via Transfer Entropy. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11059).

Requires Python 3.9 or later.

## Installation

The package can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install tefs
```

## How to use
