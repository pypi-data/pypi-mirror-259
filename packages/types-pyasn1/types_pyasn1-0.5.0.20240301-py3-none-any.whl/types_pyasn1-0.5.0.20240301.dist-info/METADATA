## Typing stubs for pyasn1

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`pyasn1`](https://github.com/pyasn1/pyasn1) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pyasn1`.

This version of `types-pyasn1` aims to provide accurate annotations
for `pyasn1==0.5.*`.
The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyasn1. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `e05098681f326b98c635853a40287ac21f771fa2` and was tested
with mypy 1.8.0, pyright 1.1.350, and
pytype 2024.2.27.
