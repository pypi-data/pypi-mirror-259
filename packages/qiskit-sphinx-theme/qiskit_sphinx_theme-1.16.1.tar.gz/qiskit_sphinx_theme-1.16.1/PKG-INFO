           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# qiskit-sphinx-theme
The Sphinx themes for Qiskit and Qiskit Ecosystem documentation.

### Warning: new theme migration

In qiskit-sphinx-theme 1.13, we added the new `qiskit` theme, which migrates from Pytorch to Furo for several improvements. qiskit-sphinx-theme 1.14 added the `qiskit-ecosystem` theme. The old Pytorch theme will be removed in qiskit-sphinx-theme 2.0, which we expect to release in July or August 2023.

See the section [Migrate from old Pytorch theme to new theme](#migrate-from-old-pytorch-theme-to-new-theme) for migration instructions.

## Overview

This repository hosts three things: 
- Qiskit Sphinx themes (located in the `src/` folder)
- Example Docs (located in the `example_docs/` folder)
- Qiskit Docs Guide (located in the `docs_guide/` folder)

The Qiskit Sphinx Themes are the themes used by Qiskit Documentation (https://qiskit.org/documentation/) and Qiskit Ecosystem projects.

The Example Docs is a minimal Sphinx project that is used for testing the Qiskit Sphinx Theme. Every
pull request will trigger [a GitHub workflow](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) that builds the Example Docs to make sure the changes do
not introduce unintended changes.

The Qiskit Docs Guide hosts instructions, guidelines and recommendations of good documentation
practices. Its intent is to help Qiskit maintainers improve the documentation of their projects.
The guide is hosted online here: https://qisk.it/docs-guide.

## Installation

This package is available on PyPI using:

```bash
pip install qiskit-sphinx-theme
```

Then, set up the theme by updating `conf.py`:

1. Set `html_theme = "qiskit-ecosystem"` (only Qiskit Terra should use `qiskit`)
2. Add `"qiskit_sphinx_theme"` to `extensions`

You also likely want to set `html_title` in `conf.py`. This results in the left sidebar having a more useful and concise name, along with the page title in the browser. Most projects will want to use this in their `conf.py`:

```python
# Sphinx expects you to set these already.
project = "My Project"
release = "4.12"

# This sets the title to e.g. `My Project 4.12`.
html_title = f"{project} {release}"
```

## Enable translations

First, coordinate with the Translations team at https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-translations to express your interest and to coordinate setting up the infrastructure.

Once the Translations team is ready, then update your `conf.py`:

* Ensure that `qiskit_sphinx_theme` is in the `extensions` setting.
* Set the option `translations_list` to a list of pairs of the locale code and the language name, e.g. `[..., ("de_DE", "German")]`.
* Set the option `docs_url_prefix` to your project's URL prefix, like `ecosystem/finance`.

For example:

```python
extensions = [
   ...,
   "qiskit_sphinx_theme",
]

translations_list = [
    ('en', 'English'),
    ('bn_BN', 'Bengali'),
    ('fr_FR', 'French'),
    ('de_DE', 'German'),
]

docs_url_prefix = "ecosystem/finance"
```

## Enable Previous Releases

This feature allows you to link to previous versions of the docs in the left sidebar.

First, start additionally deploying your docs to `<project-prefix>/stable/<version>/`, e.g. `/ecosystem/finance/stable/0.5/index.html`. See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments/blob/227867937a08075092cd11756214bee3fb1d4d3d/tools/deploy_documentation.sh#L38-L39 for an example.

Then, update your `conf.py`:

* Ensure that `qiskit_sphinx_theme` is in the `extensions` setting.
* Add to the option `html_context` an entry for `version_list` with a list of the prior versions, e.g. `["0.4", "0.5"]`.
  * Each of these versions must be deployed with the above `stable/<version>` URL scheme.
  * You can manually set this, or some projects write a Sphinx extension to dynamically compute the value.
  * You should only put prior versions in this list, not the current release.
* Set the option `docs_url_prefix` to your project's URL prefix, like `ecosystem/finance`.

For example:

```python
extensions = [
   ...,
   "qiskit_sphinx_theme",
]

html_context = {
   "version_list": ["0.4", "0.5"],
}

docs_url_prefix = "ecosystem/finance"
```

## Use custom RST directives

The `qiskit_sphinx_theme` extension defines the below custom directives for you to use in RST, if you'd like. See `example_docs/docs/sphinx_guide/custom_directives.rst` for examples of how to use them.

* `qiskit-card`
* `qiskit-call-to-action-item` and `qiskit-call-to-action-grid`

![](tests/js/qiskit.test.js-snapshots/custom-directives-2-linux.png)

## Enable Qiskit.org Analytics

Qiskit.org uses Segment Analytics to collect information on traffic to sites under the qiskit.org domain. This is not enabled by default but if you would like to enable it you can add a `analytics_enabled` variable to the `html_context` object in your `conf.py`. Setting this to `True` will enable analytics for your site once it is deployed to `qiskit.org/`.

```python
html_context = {
    'analytics_enabled': True
}
```

By enabling analytics we will be able to collect information on number of visits to each documentation page. It will also trigger the addition of a `Was this page helpful?` component at the bottom of each documentation page, so users will be able to provide yes/no feedback for each page.

![](tests/js/qiskit.test.js-snapshots/footer-includes-page-analytics-1-linux.png)

If you do not enable analytics, no data will be collected and the `Was this page helpful?` component will not show.

## Add an announcement banner to all pages

> :warning: **Note:** This feature is currently only available for the Qiskit theme, it is not yet available in the Ecosystem theme


The `qiskit` theme includes the ability to add a custom announcement banner to every page. You can configure this in your `conf.py` by adding your
custom announcement text to the `theme_announcement` variable in the `html_context` object, for example:

```
html_context = {
    "theme_announcement": "🎉 Custom announcement text!",
}
```
The above code will enable the following banner:

<img width="1330" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 5 13 10 PM" src="https://github.com/qiskit-community/ecosystem/assets/23662430/cbb86903-17fd-4752-a955-5e8c5eda3383">

You can also optionally add a "Learn more" url by additionally setting the `announcement_url` in the `html_context`, like so:

```
html_context = {
    "theme_announcement": "🎉 Custom announcement text!",
    "announcement_url": "https://example.com"
}
```
The above code will render the following banner:

<img width="1327" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 5 12 02 PM" src="https://github.com/qiskit-community/ecosystem/assets/23662430/79ccb19d-3392-4ea9-993e-b006dc7481dc">

The default text for the link is "Learn more" but you can provide custom link text by setting the `announcement_url_text` in the `html_context`:
```
html_context = {
    "theme_announcement": "🎉 Custom announcement text!",
    "announcement_url": "https://example.com",
    "announcement_url_text": "Check it out",
}
```

## Customize or disable the Ecosystem theme logo

The `qiskit-ecosystem` theme includes the Qiskit Ecosystem logo by default.

You can use a custom logo by adding a logo file (SVG or PNG) as a sibling to your `conf.py`, e.g. `docs/logo.svg`. Then, set `html_logo` in `conf.py` to the name of the file, e.g. `html_logo = "logo.png"`.

When using a custom logo, you may want to disable the project's name in the sidebar by setting `sidebar_hide_name` in `html_theme_options`:

```python
html_theme_options = {
    "sidebar_hide_name": True,
}
```

You can disable logos by setting `disable_ecosystem_logo` in `html_theme_options`:

```python
html_theme_options = {
    "disable_ecosystem_logo": True,
}
```

## IBM Projects: how to use blue color scheme for Ecosystem theme

By default, the `qiskit-ecosystem` theme uses purple as an accent color. Most projects should continue to use this, but certain highly IBM-affiliated projects like Qiskit IBM Runtime can change the accent color to blue by setting up `conf.py` like this:

```python
# Only intended for specific IBM projects.
html_theme_options = {
    "light_css_variables": {
        "color-brand-primary": "var(--qiskit-color-blue)",
    }
}
```

## Migrate from old Pytorch theme to new theme

In qiskit-sphinx-theme 1.13, we migrated to a new Sphinx theme called `qiskit`, which is based on Furo from the pip, Black, and attrs documentation. See https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/issues/232 for the motivation. qiskit-sphinx-theme 1.14 added the `qiskit-ecosystem` theme for Ecosystem projects.

qiskit-sphinx-theme 1.13+ continues to support the legacy Pytorch theme, but support will be removed in version 2.0.

To migrate, in `conf.py`:

1. Ensure that `"qiskit_sphinx_theme"` is in the `extensions` list.
2. Set `html_theme = "qiskit-ecosystem"` rather than `"qiskit_sphinx_theme"`. (`qiskit` should only be used by Qiskit Terra.)
3. Remove all `html_theme_options`.
4. Remove `expandable_sidebar` from `html_context`, if set. If it was set, follow the below section [How to migrate expandable_sidebar](#how-to-migrate-expandable_sidebar).

Render the docs and check that everything looks how expected. If not, please open a GitHub issue or reach out on Slack for help.

### How to migrate expandable_sidebar

With the old theme, to have expandable folders, you had to have a dedicated `.. toctree ::` directive with a `:caption:` option, like this:

```rst
.. toctree::
  :caption: My Folder
  :hidden:

  Page 1 <page1>
  Page 2 <page2>
```

Instead, the new theme will render the `:caption:` as a top-level section header in the left sidebar, with top-level entries for each page. See the screenshot in the PR description of https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit_sphinx_theme/pull/384 for an example of how the old theme renders `:caption:` and compare to [the new theme](tests/js/qiskit.test.js-snapshots/left-side-bar-renders-correctly-1-linux.png).

Additionally, the new theme renders pages with their own subpages as expandable folders, unlike the old theme. [For example](tests/js/qiskit.test.js-snapshots/left-side-bar-renders-correctly-1-linux.png), `<apidocs/index>` will include all subpages that are listed in the `.. toctree ::` of the page `apidocs/index.rst`.

So, when migrating, you have to decide which behavior you want:

- Use the new theme's style. No changes necessary.
- Use the new theme's style, but get rid of the top level section header. To implement:
  1. Consolidate the `.. toctree ::` directive with earlier ones so that they are all in the same `toctree`.
- Keep the `:caption:` as an expandable folder, rather than a top-level section header. To implement:
  1. Create a new directory and RST file like `my_folder/index.rst`.
  2. Move the `.. toctree::` directive to that page.
  3. Get rid of the `:caption:` option.
  4. Link to the new file `my_folder/index.rst` in the parent `index.rst` by adding it to a `.. toctree ::` in the parent.

## Tip: suggested site structure

To keep UX/UI similar across different Qiskit packages, we encourage the following structure for you sidebar, which can be set in the toctree of your `index.rst`:

```rst
.. toctree::
  :hidden:

   Documentation Home <index>
   Getting Started <getting_started>
   Tutorials <tutorials/index>
   How-to Guides <how_to/index>
   API Reference <apidocs/index>
   Explanations <explanations/index>
   Release Notes <release_notes>
   GitHub <https://github.com/your-repo>
```

Each item in the toctree corresponds to a single `.rst` file, and can use internal links or external. External links will have a "new tab" icon rendered next to them.
