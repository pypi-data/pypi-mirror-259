OneDiff is **an out-of-the-box acceleration library for diffusion models**  (especially for HF diffusers, ComfyUI, and Stable Diffusion web UI).

OneDiff is the abbreviation of "**one** line of code to accelerate **diff**usion models".

## OneDiff Installation
### Install from source

#### 1. Install OneFlow
> **_NOTE:_** We have updated OneFlow a lot for OneDiff, so please install OneFlow by the links below.

- **CUDA 11.8**

  ```bash
  # For NA/EU users
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu118
  ```


  ```bash
  # For CN users
  python3 -m pip install --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu118
  ```


<details>
<summary> Click to get OneFlow packages for other CUDA versions. </summary>

- **CUDA 12.1**

  ```bash
  # For NA/EU users
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu121
  ```


  ```bash
  # For CN users
  python3 -m pip install --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu121
  ```


- **CUDA 12.2**

  ```bash
  # For NA/EU users
  python3 -m pip install -U --pre oneflow -f https://github.com/siliconflow/oneflow_releases/releases/expanded_assets/community_cu122
  ```

  ```bash
  # For CN users
  python3 -m pip install --pre oneflow -f https://oneflow-pro.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/branch/community/cu122
  ```



</details>


#### 2. Install torch and diffusers
```
python3 -m pip install "torch" "transformers==4.27.1" "diffusers[torch]==0.19.3"
```

#### 3. Install OneDiff

- From PyPI
```
python3 -m pip install --pre onediff
```
- From source
```
git clone https://github.com/siliconflow/onediff.git
cd onediff && python3 -m pip install -e .
```

> **_NOTE:_** If you intend to utilize plugins for ComfyUI/StableDiffusion-WebUI, we highly recommend installing OneDiff from the source rather than PyPI. This is necessary as you'll need to manually copy (or create a soft link) for the relevant code into the extension folder of these UIs/Libs.

#### 4. (Optional)Login huggingface-cli

```
python3 -m pip install huggingface_hub
 ~/.local/bin/huggingface-cli login
```

## Release

- run examples to check it works

  ```bash
  cd onediff_diffusers_extensions
  python3 examples/text_to_image.py
  ```

- bump version in these files:

  ```
  .github/workflows/pub.yml
  src/onediff/__init__.py
  ```

- install build package
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install build
  ```

- build wheel

  ```bash
  rm -rf dist
  python3 -m build
  ```

- upload to pypi

  ```bash
  twine upload dist/*
  ```
