# APLR
Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression.

# About
Build predictive and interpretable parametric regression or classification machine learning models in Python based on the Automatic Piecewise Linear Regression (APLR) methodology developed by Mathias von Ottenbreit. APLR is often able to compete with tree-based methods on predictiveness, but unlike tree-based methods APLR is interpretable. See the ***documentation*** folder for more information. 

# How to install
***pip install aplr***

# Availability
Currently available for Windows and most Linux distributions.

# How to use
Please see the two example Python scripts in the ***examples*** folder. They cover common use cases, but not all of the functionality in this package. For example, fitting with user-specified observation weights is possible but the example scripts do not use this functionality.
