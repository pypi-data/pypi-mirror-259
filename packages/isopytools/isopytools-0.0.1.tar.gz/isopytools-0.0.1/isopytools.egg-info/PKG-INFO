## isopytools

Make ISODISTORT output compatible with diffpy.srfit.

This package provides tools to convert ISODISTORT output into a format compatible with diffpy.srfit for performing PDF fits with symmetry modes as fitting variables.


## Requirements

Minimum requirements: sympy, diffpy.srfit, diffpy.structure

Recommended: DiffPy-CMI library (https://www.diffpy.org/products/diffpycmi/index.html)

## Installation

After installing the dependencies, run the command:

    >>> pip install diffpy.mpdf

Alternatively, you can install from source by cloning or downloading the github repository https://github.com/FrandsenGroup/isopytools on your local machine, navigating to the downloaded repository, and running the following command:

    >>> python setup.py install
