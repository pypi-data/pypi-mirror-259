# Overview
Single-cell multi-omics (scMulti-omics) technologies enable simultaneous measurements of diverse modalities within individual cells and have the potential to comprehensively unravel cellular functions and interactions. Despite this promise, the complexity, high-dimensionality, and heterogeneity of the datasets pose significant challenges to integrative analysis. Here, we develop a single-cell multi-omics deep learning model (scMDCF) based on contrastive learning that is designed to efficiently characterize different types of omics data and capture potential features in the data through deep embedding for a complete and integrated analysis. In scMDCF, we propose a cross-modality contrastive learning module to unify representations from various omics types to ensure consistency, while the cross-modality feature fusion module utilizes conditional entropy to preserve the heterogeneity information. Extensive empirical studies have confirmed that scMDCF outperforms other state-of-the-art scMulti-omics models across various types of scMulti-omics data. In particular, scMDCF demonstrates advanced capability in determining the vital cell-type specific peak-gene associations and cis-regulatory elements from SNARE-seq data as well as surmizing immune regulation within cellular differentiation pathways from CITE-seq data. In addition, we demonstrate that in the post-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination dataset, scMDCF successfully provides annotations on the specific vaccine-induced B cell subpopulations in each modality and reveals the dynamic interactions and regulatory mechanisms within the post-vaccination immune system after vaccination.
