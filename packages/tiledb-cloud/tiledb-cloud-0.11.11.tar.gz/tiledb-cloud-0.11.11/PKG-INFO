### Testing

- Selection:
  - All tests: `pytest`
  - All tests with verbosity: `pytest -vs`
  - Tests with `taskgraphs` in their names: `pytest -vsk taskgraphs`
- Credentials:
  - These tests run on TileDB Cloud using your current environment variable `TILEDB_REST_TOKEN` -- you will need a valid API token for the tests to pass
  - For continuous integration, the token is configured for the `unittest` user and all tests should pass
  - For interactive use, if your `TILEDB_REST_TOKEN` points to your own account, most tests will run, except for those that explicitly check against contents of the `unittest` account which are skipped
