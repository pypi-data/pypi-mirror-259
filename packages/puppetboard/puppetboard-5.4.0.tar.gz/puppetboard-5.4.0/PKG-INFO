Puppetboard is a web interface to [PuppetDB](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/index.html) aiming to replace
the reporting functionality of [Puppet Enterprise console (previously: Puppet Dashboard)](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/console_accessing.html)
for the open source Puppet.

## Requirements<a id="requirements"></a>

* PuppetDB v. 5.2-8.*
  * (**Note**: PuppetDB 8.1.0 is not supported because of [this bug](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb/issues/3866). Please update to 8.1.1+.)
* Python 3.8-3.11 or Docker

## Installation<a id="installation"></a>

Puppetboard is packaged and available on PyPI.

### With Puppet module

There is a [Puppet module](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/puppet/puppetboard) originally written by
 [Spencer Krum](https://github.com/nibalizer) and currently maintained by [Voxpupuli](https://voxpupuli.org/)
that takes care of installing the Puppetboard for you.

To see how to get it working with RedHat/Centos 7 check out these [docs](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/blob/master/docs/EL7.md).

### Using Docker

We provide [an official Docker image in the GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/voxpupuli/packages/container/package/puppetboard).

You must provide a secret key! Generate one for example by running `ruby -e "require 'securerandom'; puts SecureRandom.hex(32)"`.

You can run the app on your PuppetDB host with this command:

```bash
docker run -it \
  -e PUPPETDB_HOST=localhost \
  -e PUPPETDB_PORT=8080 \
  -e SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXX \
  --net=host \
  ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetboard
```

Optionally you can set `PUPPETBOARD_URL_PREFIX` env variable to a value like `/puppetboard` to run the app under a URL prefix.

You can use the following Puppet Code to have Puppetboard managed by Puppet:

```puppet
include docker

docker::image { 'ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetboard': }

docker::run { 'puppetboard':
  image => 'ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetboard',
  env   => [
    'PUPPETDB_HOST=127.0.0.1',
    'PUPPETDB_PORT=8080',
    'PUPPETBOARD_PORT=8088',
    'SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXX',
  ],
  net   => 'host',
}
```

If you want to have all features enabled, you must use SSL talking to PuppetDB:

```puppet
file { '/etc/puppetboard':
  ensure => directory,
}
file { '/etc/puppetboard/key.pem':
  ensure => file,
  mode   => '0644',
  source => "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/private_keys/${facts['networking']['fqdn']}.pem",
}
file { '/etc/puppetboard/cert.pem':
  ensure => file,
  mode   => '0644',
  source => "/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/${facts['networking']['fqdn']}.pem",
}

include docker

docker::image { 'ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetboard': }

docker::run { 'puppetboard':
  image   => 'ghcr.io/voxpupuli/puppetboard',
  volumes => ['/etc/puppetboard:/etc/puppetboard:ro'],
  env     => [
    'PUPPETDB_HOST=puppet', # this must be the certname or DNS_ALT_NAME of the PuppetDB host
    'PUPPETDB_PORT=8081',
    'PUPPETBOARD_PORT=8080',
    'ENABLE_CATALOG=true',
    'PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY=false',
    'PUPPETDB_KEY=/etc/puppetboard/key.pem',
    'PUPPETDB_CERT=/etc/puppetboard/cert.pem',
    'SECRET_KEY=XXXXXXXX',
    'DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT=*',
  ],
  net     => 'host',
}
```

Within an air gapped environment you want to load all content from your local puppetboard web service.
Add: `'OFFLINE_MODE=true',` to the `env` parameter list of the `docker::run` Puppet type.

We also provide the Dockerfile, so you can build the image yourself:
```bash
docker build -t puppetboard .
```

### From a package

Actively maintained packages:

* [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/www/py-puppetboard/)
  maintained by [Romain Tarti√®re](https://github.com/smortex)
* [OpenBSD](https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/www/puppetboard/)
  maintained by [Sebastian Reitenbach](https://github.com/buzzdeee)

### Manually

You can also install the package from PyPI and configure a WSGI-capable application server to serve it.

We recommend using virtualenv to provide a separate environment for the app.

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install puppetboard
```

Please see [an article about more deployment setups here](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/blob/master/docs/Deployment-setups.md).

## Configuration<a id="configuration"></a>

### Puppet agents

The default value of `usecacheonfailure = true` configuration setting for Puppet agents causes Puppet runs to always succeed,
event if there are catalog compilation failures f.e. because of a syntax error in your code. This is because in such
cases with this setting Puppet will just use a cached working catalog and report the run to PuppetDB as successful.
(Although with an error visible in the Puppet run log.)

Therefore, to show the nodes with a catalog compilation as failed in Puppetboard you need to set
`usecacheonfailure = false` in your nodes' `puppet.conf`.

### PuppetDB

Of course you need to configure your Puppet Server to store the Puppet run reports in PuppetDB.
If you haven't done that already please follow the [PuppetDB documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/connect_puppet_server.html)
about this.

If you run Puppetboard on a different host than PuppetDB then you may want to configure the certificate
allow-list for which certificates are allowed to access data from PuppetDB.
Please read more about this feature in the [PuppetDB documentation here](https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/configure.html#certificate-allowlist).

### App settings

Puppetboard will look for a file pointed at by the `PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS` environment variable.
The file has to be identical to
[default_settings.py](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/blob/master/puppetboard/default_settings.py)
but should only override the settings you need changed.

If you run PuppetDB and Puppetboard on the same machine the default settings provided will be enough to get you started
and you won't need a custom settings file.

Assuming your webserver and PuppetDB machine are not identical you will at least have to change the following settings:

-   `PUPPETDB_HOST`
-   `PUPPETDB_PORT`

By default PuppetDB requires SSL to be used when a non-local client wants to connect. Therefore you'll also have to
supply the following settings:

-   `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY = True`
-   `PUPPETDB_KEY = /path/to/private/keyfile.pem`
-   `PUPPETDB_CERT = /path/to/public/keyfile.crt`

When using the Puppetboard Docker image, you may also pass Puppetboard it's certificate contents via these environment
variables, either as a multiline string or pre-base64 encoded. This can be useful where the certificate is stored in a
secrets store i.e. AWS SSM Parameter Store.

```
PUPPETDB_CERT="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```

```
PUPPETDB_CERT=LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQouLi4KLS0tLS1FTkQgQ0VSVElGSUNBVEUtLS0tLQ==
```

For information about how to generate the correct keys please refer to the
[pypuppetdb documentation](https://pypuppetdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/connecting.html#ssl). Alternatively it is possible
to explicitly specify the protocol to be used setting the `PUPPETDB_PROTO` variable.

Other settings that might be interesting, in no particular order:

- `SECRET_KEY`: set this to a long string, **the same for each application replica**, and keep it secret. Refer to
    [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/quickstart/#sessions), section
    "How to generate good secret keys" for more info. Cannot be an empty string, which is the default.
- `FAVORITE_ENVS`: an ordered list of Puppet environment names that will be shown immediately after "All Environments"
    and before other environments (which are sorted by name) in the dropdown for choosing the environment shown
    in the top-right of the UI. Environments listed here that do not really exist in your deployment are silently ignored.
- `SHOW_ERROR_AS`: `friendly` or `raw`. The former makes Puppet run errors in Report and Failures views shown
    in a modified, (arguably) more user-friendly form. The latter shows them as they are.
    Defaults to `friendly`.
- `CODE_PREFIX_TO_REMOVE`: what code path that should be shortened in "Friendly errors" to "‚Ä¶" for readability.
    A regexp. Defaults to `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments(/.*?/modules)?`.
- `PUPPETDB_TIMEOUT`: Defaults to 20 seconds, but you might need to increase this value. It depends on how big the
    results are when querying PuppetDB. This behaviour will change in a future release when pagination will be introduced.
- `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS`: The amount of hours since the last check-in after which a node is considered unresponsive.
- `LOGLEVEL`: A string representing the loglevel. It defaults to `'info'` but can be changed to `'warning'` or
    `'critical'` for less verbose logging or `'debug'` for more information.
- `ENABLE_QUERY`: Defaults to `True` causing a Query tab to show up in the web interface allowing users to write
    and execute arbitrary queries against a set of endpoints in PuppetDB. Change this to `False` to disable this.
    See `ENABLED_QUERY_ENDPOINTS` to fine-tune which endpoints are allowed.
- `ENABLED_QUERY_ENDPOINTS`: If `ENABLE_QUERY` is `True`, allow to fine tune the endpoints of PuppetDB APIs that
    can be queried. It must be a list of strings of PuppetDB endpoints for which the query is enabled.
    See the `QUERY_ENDPOINTS` constant in the `puppetboard.app` module for a list of the available endpoints.
- `GRAPH_TYPE`: Specify the type of graph to display.   Default is
    pie, other good option is donut.   Other choices can be found here:
    [C3.js documentation](https://c3js.org/examples.html#chart)
- `GRAPH_FACTS`: A list of fact names to tell PuppetBoard to generate a pie-chart on the fact page. With some fact
    values being unique per node, like ipaddress, uuid, and serial number, as well as structured facts it was no longer
    feasible to generate a graph for everything.
- `INVENTORY_FACTS`: A list of tuples that serve as the column header and the fact name to search for to create
    the inventory page. If a fact is not found for a node then `undef` is printed.
- `INVENTORY_FACT_TEMPLATES`: A mapping between fact name and jinja template to customize display
- `ENABLE_CATALOG`: If set to `True` allows the user to view a node's latest catalog. This includes all managed
    resources, their file-system locations and their relationships, if available. Defaults to `False`.
- `REFRESH_RATE`: Defaults to `30` the number of seconds to wait until the index page is automatically refreshed.
- `DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT`: Defaults to `'production'`, as the name suggests, load all information filtered by this
    environment value.
- `REPORTS_COUNT`: Defaults to `10` the limit of the number of reports to load on the node or any reports page.
- `OFFLINE_MODE`: If set to `True` load static assets (jquery, semantic-ui, etc) from the local web server instead
    of a CDN. Defaults to `False`.
- `DAILY_REPORTS_CHART_ENABLED`: Enable the use of daily chart graphs when looking at dashboard and node view.
- `DAILY_REPORTS_CHART_DAYS`: Number of days to show history for on the daily report graphs.
- `DISPLAYED_METRICS`: Metrics to show when displaying node summary. Example: `'resources.total'`, `'events.noop'`.
- `TABLE_COUNT_SELECTOR`: Configure the dropdown to limit number of hosts to show per page.
- `LITTLE_TABLE_COUNT`: Default number of reports to show when when looking at a node.
- `NORMAL_TABLE_COUNT`: Default number of nodes to show when displaying reports and catalog nodes.
- `LOCALISE_TIMESTAMP`: If set to `True` then timestamps are shown using your browser's timezone. Otherwise UTC is used. Defaults to `True`.
- `WITH_EVENT_NUMBERS`: If set to `True` then Overview and Nodes list shows exact number of changed resources
    in the last report. Otherwise shows only 'some' string if there are resources with given status. Setting this
    to `False` gives performance benefits, especially in big Puppet environments (more than few hundreds of nodes).
    Defaults to `True`.
- `ENABLE_CLASS`: If set to `True` allows the user to view the number of resource events (number of changed resources in the last report) grouped by class.
    The resource events are grouped by their status ('failure', 'success', 'noop').
- `CLASS_EVENTS_STATUS_COLUMNS`: A mapping between the status of the resource events and the name of the columns of the table to display.
- `CACHE_TYPE`: Specifies which type of caching object to use when `SCHEDULER_ENABLED` is set to `True`.
    The cache is used for the classes view (`ENABLE_CLASS` is set to `True`) which requires parsing the events of all the latest reports to group them by Puppet class.
    If the last report is present in the cache, we do not parse the events, which avoids unnecessary processing.
    If you configure more than one worker, you must use a shared backend (e.g. `MemcachedCache`) to allow the sharing of the cache between the processes.
    Indeed, the `SimpleCache` type does not allow sharing the cache between processes, it uses the process memory to store the cache.
    Defaults to `SimpleCache`.
- `CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`: Cache lifetime in second. Defaults to `3600`.
- `SCHEDULER_ENABLED`: If set to `True` then a scheduler instance is created in order to execute scheduled jobs. Defaults to `False`.
- `SCHEDULER_JOBS`: List of the scheduled jobs to trigger within a worker.
    A job can for example be used to compute a result to be cached. This is the case for the classes view which uses a job to pre-compute at regular intervals the results to be displayed.
    Each scheduled job must contain the following fields: `id`, `func`, `trigger`, `seconds`.
- `SCHEDULER_LOCK_BIND_PORT`: Specifies an available port that allows a single worker to listen on it.
    This allows to configure scheduled jobs in a single worker. Defaults to `49100`.

## Getting Help<a id="getting-help"></a>

For questions or bug reports you can file an [issue](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues).

## Contributing<a id="contributing"></a>

### Development

Puppetboard relies on the [pypuppetdb](https://pypi.org/project/pypuppetdb/) library to fetch data from PuppetDB
and is built with the help of the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) microframework.

If you wish to hack on Puppetboard you should fork/clone the Github repository and then install the requirements through:

```bash
pip install --upgrade wheel setuptools
python setup.py develop
pip install --upgrade -r requirements-test.txt
mypy --install-types --non-interactive puppetboard/ test/
```

You're advised to do this inside a virtualenv specifically created to work on Puppetboard as to not pollute your global Python installation.

You can run the tests with:
```bash
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=xml --strict-markers --mypy puppetboard test
pylint --errors-only puppetboard test
```

You can run the app it in development mode by simply executing:

```bash
flask run
```

You can specify listening host and port with environment variables or command line otions:

```bash
export FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8000

flask run
```

or

```bash
flask run --host '0.0.0.0' --port '8000'
```


Use `PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS` to change the different settings or patch `default_settings.py` directly.
Take care not to include your local changes on that file when submitting patches for Puppetboard.
Place a `settings.py` file inside the base directory of the git repository that will be used, if the environment
variable is not set.

## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/tree/v5.0.0) (2023-07-27)

* Stop setting `SECRET_KEY` value to a random string by default. This has caused issues in deployments with more than one app replica or when the app was restarted. Please set this to your own long, random string, **the same for each application replica**. Implements [#721](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/721).
* Drop support for Python 3.7 (end-of-life in June 2023). PR [#899](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/899)
* Fix broken links in Classes view. PR [#868](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/868), fixes [#816](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/816).
* Fix if fact is `None` (default for full node view). PR [#908](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/908), fixes [#907](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/907).

4.2.6
-----

4.2.2
-----
* Showing debug messages using a different color than the error messages in the Logs of the Report view. (PR [#725](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/725))   
* Start warning that the default SECRET_KET will not be provided starting with Puppetboard 5.x - see issue [#721](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/721) for more info. (PR [#726](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/726)) 

Thanks to the contributor of this release, [Shawn Toffel](https://github.com/shawntoffel)!

4.2.1
-----
* Fix `LOCALISE_TIMESTAMP = False` and document how it works. ([#461](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/461))

4.2.0
-----
* Confirm support for Python 3.11 (final), switch the Docker image to use that version of Python.

4.1.2
-----
* Fixed incompatibility with Python 3.7 that has occurred at least in the tests (regression introduced in 4.1.1). ([#720](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/720))

4.1.1

* Big upgrade of the frontend dependencies, including migration to their maintained forks in a few cases (Semantic UI ‚Üí Fomantic UI, c3.js ‚Üí billboard.js). ([#708](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/708))

Very big thanks to [Melchior NOGUES](https://github.com/melck) who did most of the development for this release!

4.0.5
-----

Thanks to [Stephen Ryan](https://github.com/ryaner) who contributed to this release!

4.0.2
-----

* Make the app work when installed from the git repo, f.e. using the [puppet-puppetboard module](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-puppetboard). ([#704](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/704)).

4.0.1
-----

* Fix the Docker image - make the app start again. ([#701](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/701)).

Thanks to [Marcel Deglau](https://github.com/promarcel) who contributed to this release!

4.0.0
-----

This is mostly a maintenance release.

The major version is bumped because of:
* dropped support for PuppetDBs < 5.2.0 (Puppet 4 has reached its end-of-life in October 2018),
* dropped support for Python 3.6 (end-of-life in December 2021).

There might be some performance improvements thanks to the upgrade of the core dependencies - Flask, Jinja2, Werkzeug etc.

Additional improvements:
* Set custom user-agent header that will make troubleshooting easier.

3.6.1
-----

* Stop modifying the query response for showing as JSON (fixes [#695](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/695), PR [#696](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/696)).

3.6.0
-----

* Show user-friendly error message when there's a problem with connecting to the PuppetDB and just zeros instead of HTTP 404 when the PuppetDB is just yet empty ([PR #692](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/692), 
* Add a healthcheck to the Docker image ([PR #690](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/690)),
* Fix Failures view when there are no logs ([PR #693](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/693)).

Thanks to the following contributors of this release: [@ArthurWuTW](https://github.com/ArthurWuTW), [@jcpunk](https://github.com/jcpunk), [@carlosduelo](https://github.com/carlosduelo).

3.5.1
-----

* Fixed friendly error message toggle (when there is no env in the URL) ([#688](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/688)).

3.5.0
-----

* **Report** view improvements:
  * show Logs before Events as they are more useful,
  * show different, arguably more useful columns in Logs by default,
  * allow showing messages in a "friendly" mode (like in Failures view),
  * make Logs and Events filterable,
  * don't force column sizes for a better, automatic content layout,
  * use fixed-width font where it makes more sense,
* Fix mixed up normal and OFFLINE_MODE for Query view.

3.4.2
-----

* Fix auto-resize in radiator view,
* Fix Query tab cannot be disabled on Docker
* Removed unused import in setup.py,

Thanks to the following contributors of this release: [@vilhelmprytz](https://github.com/vilhelmprytz), [@ldumont](https://github.com/ldumont), [@allan-reynolds](https://github.com/allan-reynolds).

3.4.1
-----

* Fixed broken PyPI package ([#677](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/677)).
* Made the ToC links work when the README is displayed as the description in PyPI.

Thanks to the following contributors of this release: [@Rewerson](https://github.com/Rewerson), [@vchepkov](https://github.com/vchepkov).

3.4.0
-----

* **Query** view improvements:
  * Make the result clickable if a certname is in it ([#652](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/652)).
  * UX improvements: show the number of results, show a user-friendly error in case of a PQL syntax error, show a warning on empty result, use fixed-width font for matching the query with the possible error message, remove useless 'Cancel' button. ([#653](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/653)).
  * Add 'Download as CSV' and 'Download as XLSX' to the results ([#654](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/654)).
  * Make the result shareable using URL ([#657](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/657)).
* New **Failures** view for showing the first error/failed resource for all nodes with a failed puppet run. It can show both "friendly" and raw error messages ([#662](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/662)).
* Sort 'uptime' fact values correctly ([#591](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/591)).
* Visual tweaks ([#667](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/667)).
* Improvements for running with Docker:
  * Configurable binding host in Dockerfile ([#660](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/660)).
  * Allow passing PuppetDB certificates via environment variables when using Docker, in base64 encoding or not ([#671](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/671)).
  * Add Puppet code for running Puppetboard using Docker into the README ([#672](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/672)).

* Refactoring: split views into separate files ([#665](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/665)).
* Update many dependencies.

* Added Python 3.5 back into test matrix (#559)
* Fixed bug in `dailyreport.js` that caused it not to render when served under a non-default virtual host (#557)

2.1.0
-----

* Fixed Puppetboard's usage for the new metrics v2 API both on the home page for computing the average resources/node and the `Metrics` listing page. This change now supports the changes in PuppetDB >= 6.9.1 (https://puppet.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-7943/)
* Added backwards compatability support for both the metric `v1` and `v2` endpoints
  depending on the version of the server. Any PuppetDB >= `6.9.1` will be queried with
  the `v2` endpoint automatically (because `v1` is disabled from here forward). Any
  PuppetDB <= `6.9.0` will use `v1`.
* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `>=2.1.0` because changes were needed in this library to support the metrics v2 fixes.
* app.py: Added python2 backwards compatability fix for importing `urllib`.

0.0.3
-----

This release introduces a few big changes. The most obvious one is the revamped
Overview page which has received significant love. Most of the work was done by
Julius H√§rtl. The Nodes tab has been given a slight face-lift too.

Other changes:

* This release depends on the new pypuppetdb 0.1.0. Because of this the SSL configuration options have been changed:
  * `PUPPETDB_SSL` is gone and replaced by `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY` which now defaults to `True`. This only affects connections to PuppetDB that happen over SSL.
  * SSL is automatically enabled if both `PUPPETDB_CERT` and `PUPPETDB_KEY` are provided.
* Display of deeply nested metrics and query results have been fixed.
* Average resources per node metric is now displayed as a natural number.
* A link back to the node has been added to the reports.
* A few issues with reports have been fixed.
* A new setting called `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS` has been added which denotes the amount of hours after which Puppetboard will display the node as unreported if it hasn't checked in. We default to `2` hours.
* The event message can now be viewed by clicking on the event.

Puppetboard is now neatly packaged up and available on PyPI. This should
significantly help reduce the convoluted installation instructions people had
to follow.

Updated installation instructions have been added on how to install from PyPI
and how to configure your HTTPD.

0.0.2
-----

In this release we've introduced a few new things. First of all we now require pypuppetdb version 0.0.4 or later which includes support for the v3 API introduced with PuppetDB 1.5.

Because of changes in PuppetDB 1.5 and therefor in pypuppetdb users of the v2 API, regardless of the PuppetDB version, will no longer be able to view reports or events.

In light of this the following settings have been removed:

* `PUPPETDB_EXPERIMENTAL`

Two new settings have been added:

* `PUPPETDB_API`: an integer, defaulting to `3`, representing the API version we want to use.
* `ENABLE_QUERY`: a boolean, defaulting to `True`, on wether or not to be able to use the Query tab.

We've also added a few new features:

* Thanks to some work done during PuppetConf together with Nick Lewis (from Puppet Labs) we now expose all of PuppetDB's metrics in the Metrics tab. The formatting isn't exactly pretty but it's a start.
* Spencer Krum added the graphing capabilities to the Facts tab.
* Daniel Lawrence added a feature so that facts on the node view are clickable and take you to the complete overview of that fact for your infrastructure and made the nodes in the complete facts list clickable so you can jump to a node.
* Klavs Klavsen contributed some documentation on how to run Puppetboard with Passenger.

0.0.1
