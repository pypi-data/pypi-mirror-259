## [v5.0.0](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/tree/v5.0.0) (2023-07-27)

* Stop setting `SECRET_KEY` value to a random string by default. This has caused issues in deployments with more than one app replica or when the app was restarted. Please set this to your own long, random string, **the same for each application replica**. Implements [#721](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/721).
* Drop support for Python 3.7 (end-of-life in June 2023). PR [#899](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/899)
* Fix broken links in Classes view. PR [#868](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/868), fixes [#816](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/816).
* Fix if fact is `None` (default for full node view). PR [#908](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/908), fixes [#907](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/907).
* Dependencies update.

Thanks to the following contributors of this release:
* [Louis Charreau](https://github.com/lcharreau)
* [Yehuda Katz](https://github.com/yakatz)

4.3.0
-----

* Add new **Classes** view. This view lists the Puppet classes that have had at least one of their resources changed (event). ([#799](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/799)).

Big thanks to [Louis Charreau](https://github.com/lcharreau) who contributed the above feature!

4.2.6
-----

* Fix auto-resize in the Radiator view in offline mode  ([#718](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/718)).

Thanks to [René Hernandez 2nd](https://github.com/REHICode) who contributed to this release!

4.2.5
-----

* **Really** fix starting the app when the SECRET_KEY is set to `bytes` instead of `str`. ([#741](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/741)).

4.2.4
-----

* Fix starting the app when the SECRET_KEY is set to `bytes` instead of `str`. ([#741](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/741)).

4.2.3
-----

* Sort 'uptime' fact values correctly again - it was fixed in v3.4.0 but got broken in v4.1.0 ([#469](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/469)).

4.2.2
-----
* Showing debug messages using a different color than the error messages in the Logs of the Report view. (PR [#725](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/725))   
* Start warning that the default SECRET_KET will not be provided starting with Puppetboard 5.x - see issue [#721](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/721) for more info. (PR [#726](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/726)) 

Thanks to the contributor of this release, [Shawn Toffel](https://github.com/shawntoffel)!

4.2.1
-----
* Fix `LOCALISE_TIMESTAMP = False` and document how it works. ([#461](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/461))

4.2.0
-----
* Confirm support for Python 3.11 (final), switch the Docker image to use that version of Python.

4.1.2
-----
* Fixed incompatibility with Python 3.7 that has occurred at least in the tests (regression introduced in 4.1.1). ([#720](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/720))

4.1.1
-----
* Fixed showing facts with graph (regression introduced in 4.1.0). ([#719](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/719))

4.1.0
-----
* Show configurable favorite environments immediately after the "All Environments" in the dropdown. ([#705](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/705))
* Automatic OS values for Linux, macOS and Windows nodes in the Inventory view. Customizable Inventory fact values using Jinja templates. PR [#712](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/712), fixes [#485](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/485).
* Big upgrade of the frontend dependencies, including migration to their maintained forks in a few cases (Semantic UI → Fomantic UI, c3.js → billboard.js). ([#708](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/708))

Very big thanks to [Melchior NOGUES](https://github.com/melck) who did most of the development for this release!

4.0.5
-----
(4.0.4 was a partially incorrect release. Please use 4.0.5 instead.)

* Fix Puppetboard not starting on PE PuppetDB. ([#711](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/711))

4.0.3
-----

* Make facts with integer values which are strings internally findable. ([#706](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/706))

Thanks to [Stephen Ryan](https://github.com/ryaner) who contributed to this release!

4.0.2
-----

* Make the app work when installed from the git repo, f.e. using the [puppet-puppetboard module](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-puppetboard). ([#704](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/704)).

4.0.1
-----

* Fix the Docker image - make the app start again. ([#701](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/701)).
* Remove border-radius from the top menu to make it appear more clearly anchored to the page. ([#699](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/699))

Thanks to [Marcel Deglau](https://github.com/promarcel) who contributed to this release!

4.0.0
-----

This is mostly a maintenance release.

The major version is bumped because of:
* dropped support for PuppetDBs < 5.2.0 (Puppet 4 has reached its end-of-life in October 2018),
* dropped support for Python 3.6 (end-of-life in December 2021).

There might be some performance improvements thanks to the upgrade of the core dependencies - Flask, Jinja2, Werkzeug etc.

Additional improvements:
* Set custom user-agent header that will make troubleshooting easier.

3.6.1
-----

* Stop modifying the query response for showing as JSON (fixes [#695](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/issues/695), PR [#696](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/696)).

3.6.0
-----

* Show user-friendly error message when there's a problem with connecting to the PuppetDB and just zeros instead of HTTP 404 when the PuppetDB is just yet empty ([PR #692](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/692), 
* Add a healthcheck to the Docker image ([PR #690](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/690)),
* Fix Failures view when there are no logs ([PR #693](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppetboard/pull/693)).

Thanks to the following contributors of this release: [@ArthurWuTW](https://github.com/ArthurWuTW), [@jcpunk](https://github.com/jcpunk), [@carlosduelo](https://github.com/carlosduelo).

3.5.1

2.1.1
-----

* Added support for new metrics API `v2` on PuppetDB >= `5.3.11` and < `6.0.0` (#558)
* Added Python 3.5 back into test matrix (#559)
* Fixed bug in `dailyreport.js` that caused it not to render when served under a non-default virtual host (#557)

2.1.0
-----

* Fixed Puppetboard's usage for the new metrics v2 API both on the home page for computing the average resources/node and the `Metrics` listing page. This change now supports the changes in PuppetDB >= 6.9.1 (https://puppet.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-7943/)
* Added backwards compatability support for both the metric `v1` and `v2` endpoints
  depending on the version of the server. Any PuppetDB >= `6.9.1` will be queried with
  the `v2` endpoint automatically (because `v1` is disabled from here forward). Any
  PuppetDB <= `6.9.0` will use `v1`.
* pypuppetdb: raise version requirement `>=2.1.0` because changes were needed in this library to support the metrics v2 fixes.

0.0.4
-----

* Fix the sorting of the different tables containing facts.
* Fix the license in our `setup.py`. The license shouldn't be longer than 200 characters. We were including the full license tripping up tools like bdist\_rpm.

0.0.3
-----

This release introduces a few big changes. The most obvious one is the revamped
Overview page which has received significant love. Most of the work was done by
Julius Härtl. The Nodes tab has been given a slight face-lift too.

Other changes:

* This release depends on the new pypuppetdb 0.1.0. Because of this the SSL configuration options have been changed:
  * `PUPPETDB_SSL` is gone and replaced by `PUPPETDB_SSL_VERIFY` which now defaults to `True`. This only affects connections to PuppetDB that happen over SSL.
  * SSL is automatically enabled if both `PUPPETDB_CERT` and `PUPPETDB_KEY` are provided.
* Display of deeply nested metrics and query results have been fixed.
* Average resources per node metric is now displayed as a natural number.
* A link back to the node has been added to the reports.
* A few issues with reports have been fixed.
* A new setting called `UNRESPONSIVE_HOURS` has been added which denotes the amount of hours after which Puppetboard will display the node as unreported if it hasn't checked in. We default to `2` hours.
* The event message can now be viewed by clicking on the event.

Puppetboard is now neatly packaged up and available on PyPI. This should
significantly help reduce the convoluted installation instructions people had
to follow.

Updated installation instructions have been added on how to install from PyPI
and how to configure your HTTPD.

0.0.2
-----

In this release we've introduced a few new things. First of all we now require pypuppetdb version 0.0.4 or later which includes support for the v3 API introduced with PuppetDB 1.5.

Because of changes in PuppetDB 1.5 and therefor in pypuppetdb users of the v2 API, regardless of the PuppetDB version, will no longer be able to view reports or events.

In light of this the following settings have been removed:

* `PUPPETDB_EXPERIMENTAL`

Two new settings have been added:

* `PUPPETDB_API`: an integer, defaulting to `3`, representing the API version we want to use.
* `ENABLE_QUERY`: a boolean, defaulting to `True`, on wether or not to be able to use the Query tab.

We've also added a few new features:

* Thanks to some work done during PuppetConf together with Nick Lewis (from Puppet Labs) we now expose all of PuppetDB's metrics in the Metrics tab. The formatting isn't exactly pretty but it's a start.
* Spencer Krum added the graphing capabilities to the Facts tab.
* Daniel Lawrence added a feature so that facts on the node view are clickable and take you to the complete overview of that fact for your infrastructure and made the nodes in the complete facts list clickable so you can jump to a node.
* Klavs Klavsen contributed some documentation on how to run Puppetboard with Passenger.

0.0.1
