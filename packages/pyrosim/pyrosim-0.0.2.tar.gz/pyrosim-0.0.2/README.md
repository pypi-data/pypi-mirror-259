# Features

## Geographical Realism
- Integrate with geographical data sources or APIs to retrieve real-world maps, roads, and locations.
- Allow users to specify regions of interest, and generate routing problems based on actual geographical data.

## Customizable Parameters:
- Provide a wide range of parameters for users to customize, such as the number of locations, distribution of customers, vehicle capacities, time windows, and drone capabilities.
- Allow users to set constraints and preferences for their specific scenarios.

## Seasonal Variations:
- Introduce the concept of seasonal variations, where the characteristics of the routing problem (e.g., demand, road conditions) change based on seasons.
- Enable users to simulate how routing problems may differ during different times of the year.

## Traffic Conditions:
- Incorporate options to simulate varying traffic conditions throughout the day.
- Allow users to set peak hours, road closures, or traffic congestion parameters to make the generated data more dynamic.

## Dynamic Customer Behavior:
- Model dynamic customer behavior, such as changing demand patterns, cancellations, or urgency levels.
- Introduce randomness in customer behavior to simulate real-world uncertainties.

## Integration with External APIs:
- Allow users to integrate external APIs for additional data, such as weather conditions, special events, or road closures, that can impact routing decisions.

## Drone-Specific Parameters:
- Extend the data generation for Drone Routing Problems by including parameters specific to drones, such as flight range, recharge time, and restrictions on flying over certain areas.

## Data Validation:
- Implement mechanisms to validate generated data for consistency and realism.
- Provide feedback to users if the specified parameters result in unrealistic or impractical routing problems.

## Exporting to Standard Formats:
- Provide a visual preview of the generated data, allowing users to inspect the distribution of customers, road networks, and other relevant details before exporting.

## Documentation and Examples:
- Include comprehensive documentation with examples demonstrating how to use the data generation features effectively.
- Provide guidance on how users can incorporate the generated data into their own projects.
