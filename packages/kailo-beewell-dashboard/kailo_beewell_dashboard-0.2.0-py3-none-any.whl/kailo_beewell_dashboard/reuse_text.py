    # Introduction for the About page
    'about_intro': '''
This page has lots of helpful information about the research projects (Kailo
and #BeeWell), as well as advice on using and accessing this dashboard, and
some background information around young people's wellbeing.''',

    # Description of the Kailo project
    'kailo': '''
Our aim is to help local communities, young people and public service
partnerships better understand and address the root causes (and wider
determinants) of young people's mental health.

We're made up of leading academics, designers and practitioners, dedicated to
working alongside communities in specific localities. Together, we will test
and co-design evidence-based responses (in a 'framework') to these root causes,
over the next four years.

Our model is formed of three key stages:
* **Early Discovery** - here, we build strong and trusted relationships with
local partners with an aim to understand what matters locally thus, forming
communities around youth- and community-centred priorities
* **Deeper Discovery and Codesign** - this stage, which we're in currently,
sees us codesign systemic responses to social determinants.
* **Prototyping, Implementation and Testing** - this is where the learning is
applied, integrating the codesigned responses with the local system,
prototyping them and making iterative refinements along the way.

    # How to use the results from this report
    'how_to_use_results': '''
These data can provide a useful starting point for discussions about the needs
of your school population and priority areas for development and improvement.
It can also be useful in considering areas of strengths and/or helping pupils
reflect on their positive qualities.

Data in your #BeeWell report may be useful in indicating progress against
targets in your School Improvement Plan or help to identify future target
areas. It may help to identify areas of priority for staff training or be used
as context when considering academic data for participating year groups. It can
also be used as independent evidence in the context of an Ofsted inspection.

Finally, young people consulted during the set-up of #BeeWell in Greater
Manchester felt strongly that pupils should be included in discussions around
feedback, particularly to plan activities and approaches to raise awareness of
strengths or difficulties the #BeeWell survey may highlight. They suggested
involving a range of students (not just those involved in school councils) in
planning how to raise awareness about wellbeing and to support the needs of
young people.''',

    # Viewing dashboard on different devices
    'view_devices': '''
Yes - this dashboard will resize so you should be able to access it on a range
of devices (computer/laptop, tablet, phone, etc).''',

    # Will there be support for interpreting and actioning on results?
    'dashboard_support': '''
Yes - Child Outcomes Research Consortium (CORC) has been funded to provide
seminars and 1:1 support to schools in Northern Devon, to help you understand
how to navigate the dashboard, interpret results, and suggest feedback in the
development of action plans. You should receive information about this via
email, but if you have not or have any questions, please contact us at
kailobeewell@dartington.org.uk.''',

    # Context of what already know about YP wellbeing
    'wellbeing_context': '''
* The peak age of onset of mental health difficulties is 14.5 years.<sup>[1]
</sup>
* Mental health and wellbeing in adolescence predicts adult health, labour
market and other important outcomes.<sup>[2]</sup>
* The wellbeing of adolescents has decreased in the last two decades, while the
prevalence of mental health difficulties among them has increased.<sup>[3,4]
</sup>
* A recent international study ranked the UK’s young people fourth from bottom
across nearly 80 countries in terms of life satisfaction.<sup>[5,6]</sup>
* Young people’s mental health and wellbeing can be influenced by multiple
drivers, including their health and routines, hobbies and entertainment,
relationships, school, environment and society, and how they feel about their
future.<sup>[7]</sup>

    # Caution around making comparisons between schools
    'caution_comparing': '''
Always be mindful when making comparisons between different schools. There are
a number of factors that could explain differences in scores (whether you are
above average, average, or below average). These include:

* Random chance ('one-off' findings).
* Differences in the socio-economic characteristics of pupils and the areas
where they live (e.g. income, education, ethnicity, access to services and
amenities).
* The number of pupils taking part - schools that are much smaller are more
likely to have more "extreme" results (i.e. above or below average), whilst
schools with a larger number of pupils who took part are more likely to
see average results

It's also worth noting that the score will only include results from pupils who
completed each of the questions used to calculate that topic - so does not
include any reflection of results from pupils who did not complete some or all
of the questions for that topic.
