        ```
        Take away the sensation inside
        Bitter sweet migraine in my head
        It's like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
        I can't take this feeling anymore
        
        Drain the pressure from the swelling,
        This sensations overwhelming,
        Give me a long kiss goodnight
        And everything will be alright
        Tell me that I won't feel a thing
        So give me Novacaine
        ```
