    Sites where the numbers of reference/non-reference reads are highly correlated
    with the strands of the reads. Counting the number of reference reads on the forward
    strand and on the reverse strand, and the number of alternate reads on the forward and
    reverse strand should be equivalent. With these four numbers, we
    construct a 2 x 2 contingency table and used the P-value from a Fisherâ€™s exact test
    to evaluate the correlation.

    If the pvalue is less than 0.05 we should reject the variant since the alternate and reference
    do not behave in the same way. Typically found if the alternate has a poor strand balance. Used with
    care if frequency of alternate or reference is low or deth of coverage is low.
