## Description

Generative AI models have shown tremendous usefulness in increasing
accessibility and automation of a wide range of tasks. Yet, their application to
the biomedical domain is still limited, in part due to the lack of a common
framework for deploying, testing, and evaluating the diverse models and
auxiliary technologies that are needed.  This repository contains the
`biochatter` Python package, a generic backend library for the connection of
biomedical applications to conversational AI.  Described in [this
preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06488) and used in
[ChatGSE](https://chat.biocypher.org), which is being developed at
https://github.com/biocypher/ChatGSE. More to come, so stay tuned!

BioChatter is part of the [BioCypher](https://github.com/biocypher) ecosystem, 
connecting natively to BioCypher knowledge graphs. The BioChatter paper is
being written [here](https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter-paper).

## Installation

To use the package, install it from PyPI, for instance using pip (`pip install
biochatter`) or Poetry (`poetry add biochatter`).

### Extras

The package has some optional dependencies that can be installed using the
following extras (e.g. `pip install biochatter[xinference]`):

- `xinference`: support for querying open-source LLMs through Xorbits Inference

- `podcast`: support for podcast text-to-speech (for the free Google TTS; the
paid OpenAI TTS can be used without this extra)

- `streamlit`: support for streamlit UI functions (used in ChatGSE)

## Usage

Check out the [documentation](https://biochatter.org/) for
examples, use cases, and more information. Many common functionalities covered
by BioChatter can be seen in use in the
[ChatGSE](https://github.com/biocypher/ChatGSE) code base.

for more info on computational biology usage of large language models.

## Developer notes

If you're on Apple Silicon, you may encounter issues with the `grpcio`
dependency (`grpc` library, which is used in `pymilvus`). If so, try to install
the binary from source after removing the installed package from the virtual
environment from
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72620996/apple-m1-symbol-not-found-cfrelease-while-running-python-app):

```bash
pip uninstall grpcio
export GRPC_PYTHON_LDFLAGS=" -framework CoreFoundation"
pip install grpcio==1.53.0 --no-binary :all:
