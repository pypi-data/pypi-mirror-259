A filter that accepts signals from specified sources and composes them into a RobotOutputSignal
- Signal values from `angle_sources` will be composed into `angles`
- Signal values from `angular_velocity_sources` will be composed into `angular_velocities`
- Signal values from `sensor_sources` will be composed into `sensor_values` with only one value under the name of the source output.
- Signal values from `sensors` will be composed into `sensor_values` with possibly multiple values under the name of the sensor.
