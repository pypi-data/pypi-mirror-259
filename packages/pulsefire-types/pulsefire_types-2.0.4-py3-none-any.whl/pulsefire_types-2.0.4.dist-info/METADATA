# Pulsefire
> :warning: **This package contains types only!**

Pulsefire is a modern and flexible Riot Games Python SDK. Built to be simple to use, highly configurable, and extendable. Objects and client responses are fully typed to speed coding efficiency. Support for community resources such as CDragon.

This package is a modern rework of [Pyot](https://github.com/iann838/Pyot). By comparison, code clarity has greatly improved and speed performance is more than 10x faster.
