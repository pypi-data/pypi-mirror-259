# ECES Weather Package

Welcome to the ECES Weather Package â€“ the first official release from the ECES Data Analytics Unit led by Ahmed Dawoud. This Python package provides a simple and intuitive interface to interact with weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. With it, you can fetch weather forecasts and analyze weather patterns.

## Installation

To install the ECES Weather Package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install eces-weather-package
```

Make sure you have Python and pip already installed on your system.

## Features

- **Retrieve Weather Forecasts**: Easily get weather forecasts for the next five days.
- **Temperature and Wind Data**: Access detailed temperature and wind data in a structured format.
- **Data Analysis Ready**: Integrate with Pandas for further data analysis.

## Quick Start

Here's how to use the ECES Weather Package to retrieve weather forecast data for a specified city:

```python
from eces_weather_package import Weather

# Initialize the Weather object with your API key and desired city
weather = Weather(apikey='your_openweathermap_api_key_here', city='Cairo')

# Get temperature forecast for the next 5 days
temperature_data = weather.temp_next_5_days()
print(temperature_data)

# Get wind forecast for the next 5 days
wind_data = weather.wind_next_5_days()
print(wind_data)
```

## Usage

### Initializing the Weather Object

Before you can retrieve any data, you'll need to initialize the `Weather` object with your OpenWeatherMap API key and the city you're interested in:

```python
weather = Weather(apikey='your_api_key_here', city='Cairo')
```

### Getting Temperature Data

To get the temperature forecast for the next five days:

```python
temperature_data = weather.temp_next_5_days()
print(temperature_data)
```

This will return a Pandas DataFrame with the temperature and time data.

### Getting Wind Data

Similarly, to get the wind forecast:

```python
wind_data = weather.wind_next_5_days()
print(wind_data)
```

This will return a Pandas DataFrame with wind speed and direction data.

## Future Work

We are excited to continue developing the ECES Weather Package. Future updates will include more features for weather analysis and prediction, harnessing the power of data science and machine learning.
