SeisFlows is an open-source, Python-based waveform inversion package that tackles the problems of full waveform inversion, seismic migration, and adjoint tomography. 

With a user base in both academia and industry, this package has been used for production scale inversions, some with over a billion model parameters, for research problems related to oil and gas exploration, earthquake seismology and general nonlinear optimization problems.



---

- SeisFlows is under current active development, and is bundled with other inversion software under the [adjTomo organization](https://github.com/adjtomo).

- Documentation, including install instructions, example problems and API, can be found on [Read the Docs](https://seisflows.readthedocs.io).

- If you find any issues, have questions, or would like to join the community, please feel free to open up a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/adjtomo/seisflows/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/adjtomo/discussions).
