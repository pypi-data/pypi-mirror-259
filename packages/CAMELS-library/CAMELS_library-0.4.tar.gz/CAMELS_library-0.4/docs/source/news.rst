**May 2023** The snapshots of the N-body simulations have been compressed. In order to read those snapshots with python, you need to use ``import hdf5`` and ``import hdf5plugin``. See :ref:`snapshots` for details.

**April 2023** All simulations in the Astrid suite are now publicly available. The CAMELS Multifield Dataset has also been updated and now incorporates 2D maps and 3D grids from the Astrid simulations. Halo and galaxy catalogues from both Subfind and Rockstar are also publicly available together with merger trees from SubLink and Consistent trees.

**March 2023:** A new set has been added to the IllustrisTNG suite: the BE set, for "Butterfly Effect". These 27 simulations all have the exact same initial conditions and are run with the fiducial TNG model, while capturing the intrinsic randomness of the simulation results.

**March 2023:** SubLink merger trees have been added for the IllustrisTNG suite.

**August 2022:** The CAMELS binder now has Pylians3 and the CAMELS library preinstalled.

**July 2022:** CAMELS has grown! The Astrid suite  --  containing 1,092 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with the MP-Gadget code employing the same subgrid model as the Astrid simulation  -- has been added to CAMELS. The N-body counterparts of these simulations are also available.
