.. attention::

   All the simulations in the IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, Astrid, and N-body suites are publicly available. To access other simulations (e.g. Magneticum, Swift-EAGLE, Ramses...etc) please fill up `this form <https://forms.gle/XMVwuzhCMvnhFiaHA>`_.

Data Access
***********

CAMELS data is stored at the Rusty cluster of the Flatiron Institute in New York City and its data can be accessed in different ways:


Binder
~~~~~~

Binder is a system that allows users to read and manipulate data that is hosted at the Flatiron Institute through either a Jupyter notebook or a unix shell. The user can find some basic documentation `here <https://docs.simonsfoundation.org/index.php/Public:Binder>`_. All CAMELS data can be accessed, read, and manipulated through Binder. 

.. warning::

   Two important things need to be taken into account when using Binder. First, the Binder environment is ephemeral - after a few days of inactivity its contents are deleted, so one has to be vigilant about downloading any analysis results in time. Second, Binder is not designed to carry out long and heavy calculations. In this case we recommend the user to download the data and work with it locally.

Globus
~~~~~~~

The full CAMELS data can be downloaded via globus, an online system designed to efficiently transfer large amounts of data. This is the method we recommend to transfer the data.

`Globus link <https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=58bdcd24-6590-11ec-9b60-f9dfb1abb183&origin_path=%2F>`_ 

   
url
~~~

We provide access to the full CAMELS data via a simple uniform resource locator (url). We do not recommend downloading large amounts of data through this system, as can be slow and unstable. However, for small or individual files it may be convenient.

FlatHUB
~~~~~~~

FlatHUB is a platform that allows users to explore and compare data from different simulations by browsing and filtering the data, making simple preview plots, and downloading sub-samples of the data. We provide access to the SUBFIND halo and subhalo catalogues of the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites through this platform.

Rusty
~~~~~

Users with an account on the Flatiron Institute Rusty cluster, can find all CAMELS data in ``/mnt/ceph/users/camels/PUBLIC_RELEASE``.
