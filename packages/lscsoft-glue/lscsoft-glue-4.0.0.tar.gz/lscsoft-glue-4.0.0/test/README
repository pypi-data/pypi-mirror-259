To add a new test:

1. create a Python script that defines the tests
    - please use either pytest or unittest to construct the tests
    - make sure that the script can be executed as `python <script>`,
      i.e. that it includes the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct

2. add a new entry to the `check` prerequisite in the `Makefile`, the
   entry should be the basename of the script minus the `.py` file extension,
   e.g. if the script is `test/test_module.py` the entry in the `Makefile`
   should just be `test_module`

3. run `make test_module` to verify that the test runs
