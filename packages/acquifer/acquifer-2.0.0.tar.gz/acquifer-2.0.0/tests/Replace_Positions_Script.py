"""
This script will replace the objective positions in an existing IM script with custom user-provided positions.  
Similar to what the PlateViewer is doing with pre/screen.
This script is motsly for testing, the version that is replacing with pixel positions in images is more interesting for image-analysis.

Running the script in python will prompt for an imsf script, will replace position in it, run it and return the directory where the images were saved.

REQUIREMENTS : 
	installing the acquifer python package
	an IM powered-on connected to the pc running the python script
	the option "Block remote connection" of the IM disabled in service settings
	the control software of the IM opened
