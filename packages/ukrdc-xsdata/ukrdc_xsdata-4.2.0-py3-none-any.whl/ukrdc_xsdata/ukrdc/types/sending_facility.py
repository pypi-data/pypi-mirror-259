        Schema) that the extract has been written against. This is to
        allow us to process incoming files accordingly as well as track
        which Units are submitting which version. Note that the RDA
        Schema version is unrelated to the UKRR Dataset version.
    :ivar batch_no: The batch number as used in the filenames. This
        should be incremented each time the extract is run, not per-
        patient
