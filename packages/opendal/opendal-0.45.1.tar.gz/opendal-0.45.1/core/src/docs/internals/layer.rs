//! The internal implementation details of [`Layer`].
//!
//! [`Layer`] itself is quite simple:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub trait Layer<A: Accessor> {
//!     type LayeredAccessor: Accessor;
//!
//!     fn layer(&self, inner: A) -> Self::LayeredAccessor;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `XxxLayer` will wrap input [`Accessor`] as inner and return a new [`Accessor`]. So normally the implementation of [`Layer`] will be split into two parts:
//!
//! - `XxxLayer` will implement [`Layer`] and return `XxxAccessor` as `Self::LayeredAccessor`.
//! - `XxxAccessor` will implement [`Accessor`] and be built by `XxxLayer`.
//!
//! Most layer only implements part of [`Accessor`], so we provide
//! [`LayeredAccessor`] which will forward all unimplemented methods to
//! `inner`. It's highly recommend to implement [`LayeredAccessor`] trait
//! instead.

//! [`Accessor`]: crate::raw::Accessor
//! [`LayeredAccessor`]: crate::raw::LayeredAccessor
