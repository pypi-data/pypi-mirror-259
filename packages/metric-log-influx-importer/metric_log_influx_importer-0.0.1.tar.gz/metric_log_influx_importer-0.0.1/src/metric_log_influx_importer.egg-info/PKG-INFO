# Overview
InfluxLogImporter is a Python utility designed to import metric logs into InfluxDB, a time-series database, from various data sources including flat files (CSV, JSON), APIs, and other databases. It automates the process of data transformation and loading, ensuring that metrics are stored efficiently for analysis, monitoring, and alerting purposes. This tool is particularly useful for DevOps, data engineers, and analysts looking to centralize their metric logs for better observability and operational intelligence.

# Features
