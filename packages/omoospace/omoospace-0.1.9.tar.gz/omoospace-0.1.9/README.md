Omoospace is a scalable directory structure solution for digital creation works. We provide a Python library for managing omoospace, including creating omoospace, shipping packages, setting subspace, etc.

[What is "Omoospace", and how does it rule all your creation files?](https://omoolab.github.io/Omoospace/latest/)

This library is for developing DCC plugins like blender add-ons to integrate omoospace into software. Remember, omoospace is just a directory guide. It should be easy to maintain manually. We do not recommend any over-design that only works by using plugins. This library aims to build plugins to avoid repetitive work and have a global view of the entire workspace structure, which consists of nested subspaces, not to manage a project entirely on a program without touching the folders.

We developed some plugins already:

-   [Houdini](https://github.com/OmooLab/Omoospace-Houdini)
-   [Blender](https://github.com/OmooLab/Omoospace-Blender)
