# Functions beginning with underscore:
# - Should not be used by the end user.
# - Should be as fast as possible.
# - May have assumptions on the input and on the output
#   (e.g., may assume the input is a list, or a numpy array, etc.).
#
# Functions without underscore:
# - Are available to the end user.
# - Should work when the input is a list, a numpy array, etc.
# - Should check the input whenever possible.
# - Should return a numpy array (instead of a list) whenever possible.

# TODO: Rename binlist2int and int2binlist to something better.
# TODO: Vectorize those functions (e.g., axis=1).
