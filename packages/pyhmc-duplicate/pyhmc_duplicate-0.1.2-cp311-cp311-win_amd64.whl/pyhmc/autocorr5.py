def integrated_autocorr5(x, size='cbrt'):
    r"""Estimate the integrated autocorrelation time, :math:`\tau_{int}` of a
    time series.

    This method uses the consistent non-overlapping batch means estimator [1]
    where the number of batches are chosen as functions of the overall run
    length.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape=(n_samples, n_dims)
        The time series, with time along axis 0.
    size : {'sqrt', 'cbrt'}
        The batch size. The default value is "sqroot", which uses the square
        root of the sample size. "cuberoot" will cause the function to use the
        cube root of the sample size. A numeric value may be provided if
        neither "sqrt" nor "cbrt" is satisfactory.

    Returns
    -------
    tau_int : ndarray, shape=(n_dims,)
      The estimated integrated autocorrelation time of each dimension in
      ``x``, considered independently.
