    r"""Estimate the integrated autocorrelation time, :math:`\tau_{int}` of a
    time series.

    This method fits a linear regression to the lower frequency of the
    log spectrum, which is extrapolated to zero to estimate the zero
    frequency power spectrum.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape=(n_samples, n_dims)
        The time series, with time along axis 0.
    max_length : int
        The data ``x`` is aggregated if necessary by taking batch means so that
        the length of the series is less than ``max.length``.

    Returns
    -------
    tau_int : ndarray, shape=(n_dims,)
        The estimated integrated autocorrelation time of each dimension in
        ``x``, considered independently.
