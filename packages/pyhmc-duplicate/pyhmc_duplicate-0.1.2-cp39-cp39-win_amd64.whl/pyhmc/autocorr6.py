def integrated_autocorr6(x, c=6):
    r"""Estimate the integrated autocorrelation time, :math:`\tau_{int}` of a
    time series.

    This method performancs a summation of empirical autocorrelation function,
    using Sokal's "automatic windowing" procedure. The window length, ``M`` is
    chosen self-consistently to be the smallest value such that ``M`` is at
    least ``c`` times the estimated autocorrelation time, where ``c`` should
    be a constant in the range of 4, 6, or 10. See Appendix C of Sokal 1988.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape=(n_samples, n_dims)
        The time series, with time along axis 0.
    max_length : int
        The data ``x`` is aggregated if necessary by taking batch means so that
        the length of the series is less than ``max.length``.

    Returns
    -------
    tau_int : ndarray, shape=(n_dims,)
        The estimated integrated autocorrelation time of each dimension in
        ``x``, considered independently.
