    Parameters
    ----------
    problem : Expr or nx.Graph
        The QAOA problem definition, represented as either an
        `nx.Graph` or `sympy.Expr`.
    problem_type : str
        The class of QAOA problem to solve.
    credentials : Credentials
        The credentials for running circuits on an IBM backend.
        Use the `make_credentials_for_ibmq` function from the `credentials` module
        to generate properly formatted credentials.
    backend_name : str, optional
        The backend device that should be used to run circuits. Defaults to None.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict
        The output of the solve qaoa workflow.
