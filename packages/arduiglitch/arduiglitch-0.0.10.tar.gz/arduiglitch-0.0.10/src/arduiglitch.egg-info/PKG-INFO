===========
Arduiglitch
===========

This package contains all the companion scripts required to run the Jupyterlab
notebooks of the Arduiglitch voltage glitch training developed by the
hardware security department (SAS) of l'École des Mines de Saint-Étienne.

-------------------------
Repackage a local version
-------------------------

The packages ``setuptools`` and ``build`` are required to repackage the module.
They should be installed when updating with ``pipenv update``.

The ``pyproject.toml`` contains all the configuration for the packaging process.
To build the package execute the following
commands from the root of the repository :

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv shell
    python -m build

If the packaging process went well, the module wheel should be located in
``dist/```.

To install this local version in a project, use *Pipenv* and specify the path to
the ``.whl`` file as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipenv uninstall arduiglitch
    pipenv install relative/path/to/arduiglitch/dist/arduiglitch-*.*.*-*-*-*.whl

For later local updates, the ``uninstall`` *Pipenv* command prevents the use of
a cached version in case the version number
of the new version is the same as the current one.

It is advised to change the version number in the ``pyproject.toml`` file after
each build. In such case, the path to the new module wheel needs to be adjusted
in the ``Pipfile`` and only ``pipenv update`` is required to update.
