# Ã†t (Aett) is an Event Store for Python

Provides a framework for managing event streams.

## Usage

To create an event stream to manage events, you can use the `EventStream` class.

```python
from aett.eventstore.EventStream import EventStream

# Create a new event stream
event_stream = EventStream.create('bucket_name', 'stream_name')

# Append an event to the stream
event_stream.add(SomeEvent())

# Load the event stream from the event store
event_stream = EventStream.load('bucket_name', 'stream_name', 'event_store_uri', 0, 100)
```
