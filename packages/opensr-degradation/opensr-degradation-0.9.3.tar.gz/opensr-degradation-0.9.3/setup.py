Initialize `git` inside your repo:\n\n```bash\ncd opensr-degradation && git init\n```\n\n2. If you don\'t have `Poetry` installed run:\n\n```bash\nmake poetry-download\n```\n\n> This installs Poetry as a [standalone application][fs1]. If you prefer, you can simply install it inside your virtual environment.\n\n3. Initialize Poetry and install `pre-commit` hooks:\n\n```bash\nmake install\nmake pre-commit-install\n```\n\n4. Run the codestyle:\n\n```bash\nmake codestyle\n```\n\n1. Upload initial code to GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit add .\ngit commit -m ":tada: Initial commit"\ngit branch -M main\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/csaybar/opensr-degradation.git\ngit push -u origin main\n```### Set up bots\n\n- Set up [Dependabot][hub1] to ensure you have the latest dependencies.\n- Set up [Stale bot][hub2] for automatic issue closing.\n\n### Poetry\n\nWant to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation][fs2].\n\n<details>\n<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>\n<p>\n\nPoetry\'s [commands][fs3] are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:\n\n- `poetry add numpy@latest`\n- `poetry run pytest`\n- `poetry publish --build`\n\netc.\n</p>\n</details>\n\n### Building and releasing your package\n\nBuilding a new version of the application contains steps:\n\n- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions][fs4] standard;\n- Make a commit to `GitHub`;\n- Create a `GitHub release`;\n- And... publish :slight_smile: `poetry publish --build`\n\n## :dart: What\'s next\n\nWell, that\'s up to you. :muscle:\n\nFor further setting up your project:\n\n- Look for files and sections marked with `UPDATEME`, these should be updated according to the needs and characteristics of your project;\n  - **Tip:** If you use VS Code\'s [`Todo Tree`][wn1] extension, you can even set a specific tag to quickly locate these marks. Update your `settings.json` with:\n\n```json\n"todo-tree.highlights.customHighlight": {\n    "UPDATEME": {\n        "icon": "pencil",\n        "iconColour": "#E63946"\n    }\n},\n"todo-tree.general.tags": [\n    "BUG",\n    "HACK",\n    "FIXME",\n    "UPDATEME",\n    "TODO",\n    "XXX",\n    "[ ]"\n]\n```\n\n- In order to reduce user prompts and keep things effective, the template generates files with a few assumptions:\n  - It assumes your main git branch is `master`. If you wish to use another branch name for development, be aware of changes you will have to make in the Issue and Merge Request templates and `README.md` file so links won\'t break when you push them to your repo;\n  - It generates a PyPI badge assuming you will be able to publish your project under `opensr-degradation`, change it otherwise;\n- Make sure to create your desired Issue labels on your platform before you start tracking them so it ensures you will be able to filter them from the get-go;\n- Make changes to your CI configurations to better suit your needs.\n\nIf you want to put your project on steroids, here are a few Python tools which can help you depending on what you want to achieve with your application:\n\n- [`Typer`][wn2] is great for creating CLI applications;\n- [`Rich`][wn3] makes it easy to add beautiful formatting in the terminal;\n- [`tqdm`][wn4] is a fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI;\n- [`Python Prompt Toolkit`][wn5] allows you to create more advanced terminal applications, such as a text editor or even your own shell;\n- [`orjson`][wn6], an ultra fast JSON parsing library;\n- [`Pydantic`][wn7] is data validation and settings management using Python type hinting;\n- [`Returns`][wn8] makes you function\'s output meaningful, typed, and safe;\n- [`Loguru`][wn9] makes logging (stupidly) simple;\n- [`IceCream`][wn10] is a little library for sweet and creamy debugging;\n- [`Hydra`][wn11] is a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications;\n- [`FastAPI`][wn12] is a type-driven asynchronous web framework.\n\nFor taking development and exposition of your project to the next level:\n\n- Try out some more badges, not only it looks good, but it also helps people better understand some intricate details on how your project works:\n  - You can look at dynamic badges available at [`Shields.io`][wn13];\n  - There is a myriad of standardised static badges at [`Simple Badges`][wn14];\n  - [`awesome-badges`][wn15] provides a lot of useful resources to help you deal with badges;\n- Add your project to [`OpenSSF Best Practices`][wn16] and [`OSSRank`][wn17] indexes. If you have greater ambitions for your project and/or expects it to scale at some point, it\'s worth considering adding it to these trackers;\n  - There are already badges for those set up in your `README.md` file, just waiting for you to update their URLs with your project\'s index in both services :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:\n- Setup a code coverage service for your tests, popular options include:\n  - [`Coveralls`][wn18] and [`Codecov`][wn19] if you need solely test coverage;\n  - [`Code Climate`][wn20] and [`Codacy`][wn21] for fully-featured code analysis;\n- Setup a sponsorship page and allow users and organisations who appreciate your project to help raise for its development (and add a badge in the process! :sunglasses:). Popular platforms are:\n  - [`Liberapay`][wn22];\n  - [`Open Collective`][wn23];\n  - [`Ko-fi`][wn24];\n  - You can set a [Sponsors account][hub3] directly integrated into GitHub;\n  - Of course, you can also set any kind of gateway you wish, what works best for you and your project!\n\nAnd here are a few articles which may help you:\n\n- [Open Source Guides][wn25];\n- [A handy guide to financial support for open source][wn26];\n- [GitHub Actions Documentation][hub4];\n- [Makefile tutorial][wn27];\n- [A Comprehensive Look at Testing in Software Development][wn28] is an article that lays out why testing is crucial for development success. Eric\'s blog is actually a great reference, covering topics ranging from the basics to advanced techniques and best practices;\n- Maybe you would like to add [gitmoji][wn29] to commit names. This is really funny. :grin:\n\n## :rocket: Features\n\n### Development features\n\n- Support for `Python 3.8` and higher;\n- [`Poetry`][ft1] as a dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`][ft2];\n- Automatic code formatting with [`black`][fo1], [`isort`][fo2] and [`pyupgrade`][fo3], with ready-to-use [`pre-commit`][fo4] hooks;\n- Code and docstring linting with [`flake8`][li1], [`pydocstyle`][li2] and [`pydoclint`][li3];\n- Type checks with [`mypy`][ft3], security checks with [`safety`][ft4] and [`bandit`][ft5];\n- Testing with [`pytest`][ft6];\n- Ready-to-use [`.editorconfig`][ft7] and [`.gitignore`][ft8] files.

As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you’re ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.\n\n### List of labels and corresponding titles\n|               **Label**               |      **Title in Releases**      |\n| :-----------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: |\n| `enhancement`, `feature`              | :rocket: Features               |\n| `bug`, `refactoring`, `bugfix`, `fix` | :wrench: Fixes & Refactoring    |\n| `build`, `ci`, `testing`              | :package: Build System & CI/CD  |\n| `breaking`                            | :boom: Breaking Changes         |\n| `documentation`                       | :memo: Documentation            |\n| `dependencies`                        | :arrow_up: Dependencies updates |\nYou can update it in [`release-drafter.yml`][hub8].\n\nGitHub creates the `bug`, `enhancement`, and `documentation` labels for you. Dependabot creates the `dependencies` label. Create the remaining labels on the Issues tab of your GitHub repository, when you need them.\n## :shield: Licence\n\n[![Licence][blic1]][blic2]\n\nThis project is licenced under the terms of the `MIT` licence.
