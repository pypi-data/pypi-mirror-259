# UtecIO Python Library
UNDER DEVELOPMENT

Python library for interacting with Utec devices and Ultraloq locks using Bluetooth.

This library is in initial development and will change rapidly.

If you have a specific lock request you can contribute at [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/maeneak) or [coindrop](https://coindrop.to/maeneak) to assist with purchasing of new locks for testing and accelerate development.
