GPS Tutorials
=============

Welcome to the GPS Tutorials. In this section, we present detailed examples and guides to help you understand and utilize GPS effectively. Our tutorials provide a Mouse Embryo ST data, alongside three cleaned GWAS summary statistics to demonstrate the application of GPS in spatially mapping trait-associated cells (spots).


Datasets Used in the Tutorials
-------------------------------

1. **Mouse Embryo ST Data**

   - Num of spots: 121k
   - Technology: Stereo-Seq.

2. **GWAS Data**

   - The following Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) datasets are provided to illustrate the use of GPS in understanding spatial heterogeneity in complex traits:

     1. Height - (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05275-y)
     2. IQ - (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0152-6)
     3. Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) - (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.008)
