  This sprite class can be used for any static sprite, and it is the base class

  pygame.sprite.Sprite class just with __slots__ added for optimization.


  Attributes:
    __g:
      A private dict used to store the groups that this sprite belongs to.
    image:
      The pygame.Surface image that will be rendered.
    rect:
      The pygame.Rect around the image.
    mask:
      A bitmask used for perfect collition detection. By default sprites don't
      have one. To create a sprite with a bitmask specify it in the constructor
      or with the method create_mask
    owner:
      The parent player of the sprite if it applies. If None then it means it is
      not owned by a player.
    name:
      The sprite name. This works as an identifier so is easier to find.
    subgroup:
      The subgroup that this sprite belongs to. This is only a logical grouping
      between sprites, meaning that this won't actually create an instance of
      anything, just to help with searching sprites and stuff.

  Class Attributes:
    base_speed:
      Class attribute that determinates how fast sprites move
    subclasses:
      dict of subclasses of EauSprite where each key is the name of the class
      and each value is the class itself.

      Private class attribute that stores the base path of the images of an

    Examples:

    ---

    * Using the path parameter:

    ```python
    import os
    class SomeSprite(EauSprite, path=os.path.join("path", "to", "image.png"):
      ...

    sprite1 = SomeSprite()
    sprite2 = SomeSprite()

    You can also pass the path partially, like this:

    ```python
    import os
    class SomeSprite(EauSprite, path=os.path.join("path", "to"):

    sprite1 = SomeSprite("image1.png")

    # In file2.py
    from scpup import EauSprite

    cls = EauSprite.subclasses.get('SomeSprite')
