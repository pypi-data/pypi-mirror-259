"""SCPUP Players helper module

This module has a class used to handle all player logic, meaning movement,
interaction with the game and with the other players.

Colors:

* p1: #7F1791
* p2: #028713
* p3: #808000
* p4: #008DD4

These values are stored in the EauColor enumeration, with each one representing
an enumeration member corresponding to the player id.
