"""
This example will prompt for an IM dataset directory and display it as a multi-dimensional array in napari.
Data loading use the dask-image library, which use lazy-loading, similar to the VirtualStack of ImageJ to load the images "on request"

For this example to work you need to install napari in the python environment running the example.
With pip : 
    pip install napari[all]
