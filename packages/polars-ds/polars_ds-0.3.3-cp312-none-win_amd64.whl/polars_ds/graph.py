@pl.api.register_expr_namespace("graph")
class GraphExt:
    """
    This class contains tools for working with graphs inside a dataframe. Graphs are represented by two columns:
    one node column (index, u64), which is usually implicit, and one edge column (list[u64]). ALL algorithms
    here implicitly assumes the nodes are indexed by row number starting from 0. E.g. row_number = 5, and the
    corresponding value of the edge list is [1,6,13], then it means we have a connection from 5 to 1, 5 to 6,
    and 5 to 13.

    It is the user's responsibility to ensure that edge list does not contain duplicate values and values should
    be type u64. Values will NOT be casted to u64 for the user. One can use pl.list.eval(pl.element().cast(...))
    to cast once for all graph related queries.

    Also note that some queries (e.g. shortest path) in this module is slow and is transcient, meaning that each
    query will create a graph and use it only for the duration of the query. It does not persist
    the graph. So it will be very slow if you are running multiple graph methods. The focus is not full coverage
    of graph algorithms, because not all are suitable for dataframe queries. This module mainly provides the
    convenience for common queires like deg, shortest path, etc.

    To be decided: a separate, dedicated Graph module might be appropriate.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_iter
            The number of iterations for the power iteration algorithm to compute eigenvecor centrality
        normalize
            Whether to normalize the eigenvector's elements by dividing by their sum
        sparse
            Whether the underlying adjacent matrix will be sparse or not. This is usually the case, and
            using sparse matrix we can compute this significantly faster.

        """
        Determines whether the `target` node is reachable starting from all other nodes. It will return
        a struct with 2 fields: the first (reachable) tells if the node is reachable, the other(steps)
        tells the length of the shortest path assuming constant edge cost.

        If the node is reachable and has steps = 0, the node must be the node in question itself.
        If reachable = False, and steps = 0, then it simply means the node is not reachable.

        Parameters
        ----------
        node
            An integer index for the node that we are insterested in testing reachability.

        """
        Treats self as a column of "edges" and computes the shortest path to the target by using the
        cost provided. This will treat the graph as a directed graph, and the edge (i, j) may have different
        cost than (j, i), depending on the data. This assumes all costs are positive.

        Note that this will not sort the nodes for the user. This assumes that nodes are indexed by the
        row numbers: 0, 1, ...

        Also note that if in a row, we have len(edges) != len(dist) or if either edge list has null or
        cost list has null, then this row will be disqualified, meaning that the node will be
        treated as having no connected edges.

        If you
        (1) do not need the actual path,
        (2) is fine with having constant cost for all edges, and
        (3) only cares about the cost of the shortest path,
        then `reachable` may be a better and much faster approach.

        Parameters
        ----------
        target
            If this is an int, then will try to find the shortest path from this node to the node with
            index = target. (NOT YET DECIDED): If this is an expression, then the expression must be a column
            of u64 representing points go from this node.
        cost
            If none, will use constant 1 cost for travelling from any edge. If this is an expression, it should
            represent a column of list[f64], with each list having the same length as
            the edge list, and they must not contain nulls. If these conditions are not met, this node will be
            treated as having no edges going from it. The values in the list will represent the cost (distance) to go
            from this node to the nodes in the edge list.
        parallel
            Whether to run the algorithm in parallel. The same cavaet as the one in value_counts() applies.
