TextMetrics

TextMetrics is a Python package for basic text analysis and statistics. It provides simple yet efficient functions to analyze textual data and extract useful metrics such as word count, character count, average word length, and most common words.

Features

Word Count: Count the number of words in a text.
Character Count: Count the number of characters in a text.
Average Word Length: Calculate the average length of words in a text.
Most Common Words: Find the most common words in a text.

Installation
You can install Basictextmetrics using pip:
pip install BasicTextMetrics

Usage
Here's a quick example demonstrating the usage of BasicTextMetrics:

python
Copy code
from basictextmetrics import core

text = "This is a sample text for demonstrating the BasicTextMetrics package."
print("Word count:", core.word_count(text))
print("Character count:", core.char_count(text))
print("Average word length:", core.avg_word_length(text))
print("Most common words:", core.most_common_words(text))
