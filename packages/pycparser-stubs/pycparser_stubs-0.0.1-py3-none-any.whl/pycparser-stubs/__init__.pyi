        cpp_path:
            If use_cpp is True, this is the path to 'cpp' on your
            system. If no path is provided, it attempts to just
            execute 'cpp', so it must be in your PATH.

        cpp_args:
            If use_cpp is True, set this to the command line arguments strings
            to cpp. Be careful with quotes - it's best to pass a raw string
            (r'') here. For example:
            r'-I../utils/fake_libc_include'
            If several arguments are required, pass a list of strings.

        When successful, an AST is returned. ParseError can be
        thrown if the file doesn't parse successfully.

        Errors from cpp will be printed out.
